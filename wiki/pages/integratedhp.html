<p class = "section-text">Our Integrated Human Practices approach guided every stage of our project, ensuring that our technology was not only scientifically sound but also <span class="bold-word">safe, relevant, and responsive to real-world needs</span>. By engaging with diverse stakeholders throughout the design and development process, we continuously refined our goals and implementation strategies to align with societal values, ethical standards, and technical feasibility.

<section id = "Strategy">
<h1 class = "section-title">Our strategy</h1>
<p class = "section-text">During the initial stages of our project, it was evident that we needed to set a focus and gather information about the current state of the art to make a coherent product. From the beginning, we sought guidance from a <span class="bold-word">wide range of stakeholders</span>: academic researchers, industry experts, educators, schools, former iGEM participants and mentors,  and biosecurity authorities. Our <span class="bold-word">iGEM mentor</span> was essential in teaching us how to transform external input into actionable changes and to <span class="bold-word">establish feedback loops</span> throughout the project lifecycle. These loops are the backbone of our <span class="bold-word">Integrated Human Practices (IHP)</span> strategy, in which our initial idea is evaluated by external stakeholders and refined so that it can be implemented into our project.

<p class = "section-text">In order to facilitate comprehension, you will find stakeholders organized in different <span class="bold-word">sections</span> (Engineering, Education or Biosafety compliance), in turns grouped in <span class="bold-word">smaller clusters</span> relating to the specific role they played. To better assess and prioritise stakeholders, we used a tool commonly used by previous iGEM teams: the  <span class="bold-word">Mendelow’s Matrix</span>. It helped us determine which stakeholders required more attention, communication and engagement.

<p>Our key partners were those stakeholders with both high interest and power to shape our project. These included research centers, industry advisors and regulatory and security agencies. Research centers, such as the Faculty of Biology, of the University of Barcelona, gave us access to valuable perspectives and validated the applicability of our tool in disease-relevant applications. <br><br>By consulting these institutions, we aligned our work with academic standards and benefitted from collective expertise beyond individual researchers. Industry advisors like Promega provided practical support, such as the technical know-how, reagents and assay systems and helped us bridge the gap between academic theory and practical implementation. <br><br> Industry partners contribute a real-world perspective on the usability of our product. With the early involvement of  these key actors early, we secured a reliable source of technical  knowledge grounded in extensive global lab experience - an essential foundation for credibility and reproducibility. <br><br> Moreover, and given the novelty of our project, it was crucial to contact regulatory and safety agencies to ensure our project met biosecurity standards, reassuring both the general public and institutions. By consulting IBBIS and the iGEM Safety & Security Committee, we were confident that our product posed a low intrinsic dual-use risk, while we simultaneously explored new frameworks for risk assessment and mitigation. Instead of safety as an afterthought, we  proactively integrated it into the design process, which can be demonstrated in our Dual-use assessment.

<p>We also worked with stakeholders with high interest in our project but lower formal power. Nevertheless, their insights were paramount in shaping the educational impact and the usability of our product. We worked closely with teachers and schools, where we tested our educational toolkit in real classroom environments. This was fundamental to ensure our project could have an impact beyond the lab. <br><br> Their feedback revealed the importance of age-specific framing and modulability, while also ensuring our project could function as a coherent pedagogical resource to inspire the scientists of tomorrow. In order to guarantee scientific rigor and credibility, we reached out to researchers from different fields who, in the best of cases, would become potential users of our technology. <br><br> Contacting them was particularly important as innovation often benefits from cross-disciplinary perspectives, thus expanding our understanding of potential challenges and applications we had not considered. Most importantly, these discussions ensured that our tool was not developed in isolation, but rather as part of an ongoing dialogue within the synbio community.

<p>A third group, constituted by powerful but not particularly interested stakeholders,  played a key role in the feasibility and prospects for our project. While not directly involved, government agencies and bioethics committees ensure scientific innovations remain within ethical and legal boundaries. These agencies act as gatekeepers who safeguard the public interest and ensure that emerging biotechnologies, such as ours, comply legally and institutionally. By keeping them satisfied, we built trust and credibility, reflecting our compromise of integrating proper ethics and governance into every stage of development. For that reason, we contacted Dr. Gemma Marfany, a recognised bioethics expert, to guide us in the process.

<p>The last quadrant includes stakeholders with low power and direct interest, such as the general, non-specialized public and the media. Although they did not directly influence our project, they remain an essential part of building trust, transparency and social acceptance around synthetic biology. Public perception plays a decisive role in how biotechnologies are understood, regulated and adopted, which remarks the importance of engaging with them. <br><br>Through different outreach activities, we made our work accessible to non-specialists, demystifying synthetic biology and showing that it can be developed responsibly and ethically. Complex technologies like RNA-based regulation can easily be misunderstood, which is why we accepted the challenge to take our project beyond academia and foster mutual trust between scientists and citizens.

<h1 class = "section-title">HP Cards: Making Human Practices visible</h1>
<p class = "section-text">To further reinforce our commitment to integrate our HP work, we have created <span class="highlight-word">HP Cards</span>, a new system that links our project’s key decisions to their real-world context. These cards can be found as interactive links distributed <span class="bold-word">across our wiki</span>, connecting specific concepts, design decisions or experimental conditions to the stakeholders who influenced them. <br><br>
This structure makes Human Practices a <span class="bold-word">constant presence</span> in every section in our wiki, rather than a stand-alone element. They allow readers to follow how each interaction with researchers/educators/regulatory experts directly shaped our experimental design, toolkit and safety framework. <br><br>
We like to think of HP Cards as a living record of collaboration, not detached from the scientific narrative but woven instead into our project. This interconnected system allows viewers to see not only what we did, but also why and whose input shaped it. Just as our design has <span class="bold-word">improved organically</span> during these months, the wiki now <span class="bold-word">mirrors</span> this process where real conversations turned into educated decisions.  <br><br>
Our approach not only contributes to the wiki’s internal coherence, but also offers to the broader iGEM community a <span class="bold-word">new model to reflect truthfully how Human Practices shape our projects</span>. We believe this strategy provides a holistic and transparent framework for understanding our work, and our commitment to prove that responsible innovation is not a final step but a <span class="bold-word">continuous process</span> guiding every decision we make.  <br><br>
Our take-home message is that <span class="bold-word">Human Practices should not be an appendix to science, but its foundation</span>. By making stakeholder input traceable and linking our results back to a human dialogue, we have built a system where responsibility and collaboration are embedded at the core of innovation.

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> Andrew Anzalone is a leading figure in modern genome editing, developing a prime editing technology. His prior experience working with theophylline riboswitches, like those used in our project, made him an invaluable candidate source of feedback.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> When our experiments with HEK293T cells failed to produce the expected response to theophylline, we hypothesized that the aptamer might not be folding correctly inside mammalian cells. Upon consulting Dr. Anzalone, he confirmed that he had encountered the same issue: in his work, HEK293T cells did not yield positive results, whereas yeast cells did. Together, we concluded that the discrepancy arises from temperature differences. The aptamer folds correctly at around 30 °C (in vitro and in yeast), but at 37 °C (mammalian conditions) the mRNA misfolds, disrupting functionality.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> Dr. Anzalone’s feedback was pivotal, prompting us to prioritize in vitro validation of our construct before moving to mammalian cell culture. Once a solid proof of concept is established, we can then explore strategies to overcome the temperature-dependent folding limitation and adapt our riboswitch system for mammalian applications.</li>

His research focuses on RNA structure tools to investigate both fundamental and applied aspects of gene regulation, with particular emphasis on human gene expression. His extensive background and riboswitch  expertise provided us with valuable insight.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> In an interview, Dr. Rovira discussed riboswitches in personalised medicine and gene therapy, stressing design considerations such as linker placement and SECIS modifications.

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> We carried out an adapted pilot test of the toolkit’s bioethics activity to gather direct, first-hand insights on how to improve our approach. At the end of September, they tried out the second activity of technology and gave us valuable input.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> From the bioethics pilot test we saw that while students were initially in favor of applying the new treatment in the fictional case, their opinions shifted as more complex and nuanced questions were introduced. Regarding the feedback from the technology activity, The teacher recommended adding the history of AlphaFold for context, improving the introduction’s visual appeal, and addressing speed issues. He also questioned whether AI tools like AlphaFold truly solve the structure prediction problem, or if utility should be distinguished from genuine understanding and justification.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> To better support the debate in the bioethics activity, we provided key arguments for the positions students had to defend, particularly for the teams opposing the treatment. As for the technology activity, we will work on their suggestions, trying to implement this new philosophical point of view.</li>

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> In order to test the toolkit’s technology and communication activity, we carried out a pilot test to obtain preliminary feedback and identify areas for improvement before broader implementation.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> Daina Isard school really liked our toolkit when it was presented to them. They said they wanted to test all the activities and use the toolkit as it was intended, for the moment they have tried the technology and the communication activity, but they will also do the experimental one. The technology activity was deemed a success, greatly enjoyed by the students and allowing them to understand how to use BLAST through hands-on learning. The communication activity, although positively received, was considered somewhat repetitive.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> The feedback not only allowed us to refine the activities by reducing redundancies, but also steered us to imagine how the toolkit can be better tailored to different learning contexts. These adjustments ensured greater effectiveness and potential of the toolkit in classroom settings.</li>

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> La Llar de la Recerca is a youth association dedicated to spreading science and technology amongst young people in a catalan region called Penedès, we attended an oratory workshop organised by them and led by Eulàlia Soler, professor of oratory at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> We drew inspiration from this association to shape our vision of the 360º scientist: someone with a strong cultural background and an awareness of the world around them. In the workshop, Eulàlia explained how debates are structured in official competitions, emphasized the importance of thorough preparation, and shared practical tools to improve debating skills.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> We thought of the education plan around this idea, and we adopted a structured debate format for the bioethics activity (introduction, discussion, and conclusion, with questions limited to the discussion phase) and equipped students with some of the tools and strategies introduced in the workshop.</li>

<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> As a professor and science communicator, Dr. Marfany shared her extensive experience in student engagement and pedagogy. She suggested strategies to improve engagement, underscoring retroactivity between teachers and the team to continuously refine the toolkit. She highlighted the strengths of our activities while also identifying areas for improvement, such as the lack of contextualization between our specific project and the activities.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> A key aspect was to define the demographic target of our toolkit. Given that a relative maturity is required to debate the activities, especially the debate, we ponder that ages ranging 15-17 might provide best results. With her guidance, we designed a biotechics activity that allowed even non-biology students to reflect critically on present and future challenges. Related to the DNA extraction experiment, Gemma suggested changing the media we use to spark scientific curiosity. This adjustment, along with her pedagogical insights, will allow us to strengthen the overall educational impact of the toolkit.</li>

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> The International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science is an organization devoted to act as a consultor and assessor in synbio projects. We contacted Technical Consultant Luca Boldrini, given that his prior experience with iGEM familiarized him with the specific requirements of such projects.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> They reassured that we may be overthinking, which is ultimately positive for ensuring proper use. They considered the current dual-use risk is low, emphasizing that the sequence we provide is innocuous and danger lies in the payload expressed with it, but that’s beyond our scope. As safeguards, they recommended focusing on educating users, restricting applications to non-pathogenic chassis, and considering consumer screening as a preventive measure.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> Following the IBBIS philosophy and its open-source Common Mechanism screening tool, we adopted a similar open-access approach, valuing its benefits over potential risks, and we developed a client <a class="link-text" href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5622/images/humanpractices/biosecuritycsp.pdf">screening method</a>. On their advice, we also sought further evaluation from the iGEM Safety & Security Committee for further analysis.</li>

<li><span class="bold-word">Aim:</span> We consulted the iGEM Safety & Security Committee about potential dual-use concerns related to publishing Tadpole software as open source.  To ensure responsible action, we submitted our Dual-Use Assessment based on frameworks from the Netherlands Biosecurity Office and the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM).</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Contribution:</span> The Committee congratulated us on our careful assessment and concluded that our technology does not pose an intrinsic dual-use risk. The primary concern lies not in the regulatory logic itself, but in the downstream payload that could be expressed if safeguards were bypassed. However, the Committee reassured us that current biosecurity practices are sufficiently robust to detect such risks, and that effective medical countermeasures are available.</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Implementation:</span> Now that we were confident that our software and sequences could be safely shared and published, we decided to apply for Best Composite Part. Their  feedback also empowered us to engage in discussions on risk assessment and to better anticipate how future technologies might be misused.</li>
