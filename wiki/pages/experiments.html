  <p>General scheme of experimental workflow </p>
</div>

<p>In the laboratory, we mainly carried out two types of assays: <strong>cell-based assays</strong> and <strong>cell-free system assays</strong>. Both assays share a <strong>common preliminary part</strong>.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Common part</h2>
<p>The constructs arrived from the supplier in plasmid form. In order to amplify the plasmids, we performed a standard amplification procedure using <strong>E. coli DH5α</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> We carried out a bacterial transformation by heat shock of <strong>E. coli DH5α</strong> with the plasmids of interest, and plated the bacteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Incubation:</strong> The following day, we collected colonies from the plates and incubated them in tubes with <strong>LB medium</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Plasmid purification:</strong> One day later, we purified the plasmids of interest, obtaining the desired concentration.</li>
  <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Finally, to verify the efficiency of the procedure, we measured the concentration of the purified plasmids using a <strong>Nanodrop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>All plasmids underwent this process before being used in the assays.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Cell-based assays in HEK293T</h2>
<p>Starting from the purified plasmids, we performed the assays in HEK293T cells, with plasmids of SCR-D and SECIS. A complete assay takes one week, so we always began on Monday and finished over the weekend. The process is as follows:

  <h2>Cell-free system assays</h2>

<p>Starting from the purified plasmids, we performed the <strong>cell-free system assays</strong> (<em>TnT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems</em> from Promega®, catalog #L1170), but in this case only <strong>SECIS plasmids</strong> and <strong>SECIS-related plasmids</strong> were tested. A complete assay takes one or two days. The process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Starting Material:</strong> The starting point can be either a purified plasmid or a PCR product. We incorporated <strong>Paul Copeland’s plasmid</strong> in purified plasmid form. However, we performed a PCR on the SECIS plasmids to incorporate our construct as a PCR product, since in this form it was more stable. Therefore, the first step was to run a <strong>PCR</strong> and an <strong>agarose gel electrophoresis</strong>.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Assay Setup:</strong> Once we had the PCR product, we proceeded with the cell-free system assay. The different samples were treated with <strong>selenium</strong> and/or <strong>theophylline</strong>, which were added prior to the incubation period during which <strong>transcription and translation</strong> occurred simultaneously.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Gene expression was measured through a <strong>dual-luciferase assay</strong>. Finally, we plotted and analyzed the results in <strong>RStudio</strong> and prepared a presentation to share with our PI and instructors.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Other Procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Split:</strong> This routine procedure in the team is used to replace the medium of <strong>HEK293T cells</strong> with trypsin, thereby ensuring their survival over time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Toxicity assay:</strong> This procedure involves seeding cells at different densities and treating them with increasing concentrations of <strong>theophylline</strong>, in order to establish toxicity thresholds.</li>
  <li><strong>Sanger sequencing verification:</strong> To confirm the identity and integrity of the purified constructs, plasmid samples are sent for Sanger sequencing. The results are compared to the expected construct sequences to verify that they match the intended design.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="constructs"><a class="link-text" href="https://2025.igem.wiki/barcelona-ub/parts">Constructs </a> used in the lab</h1>
<br>
The constructs used in our laboratory are divided into two main branches, according to the SCR with which they are associated. Thus, we have constructs that were used for the SCR-D experiments and constructs that were used for the SECIS experiments.

  <p>Classification of the constructs that we used in the lab </p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2 id="scr-d">SCR-D</h2>
<h4>A: Normal SCR-D (TGA):</h4>
This construct is the complete SCR-D along with the STOP 
codon on which it must act to produce readthrough, allowing the 
ribosome to bypass it. This way, Firefly luciferase will be expressed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

  >
  <p>Normal SCR-D (TGA) construct and predicted structure </p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h4>B: SCR-D controls</h4>
<p><strong>1- CGA:</strong> This construct has the first nucleotide of the STOP codon mutated 
  from T to C, so the codon is no longer a STOP codon but instead encodes an arginine. 
  In other words, each reading of the construct’s mRNA gives rise to both luciferase proteins,
   Renilla and Firefly. This serves to normalize the activity of the two luciferases and to generate 
   cleaner and more reliable graphs.</p>

  >
  <p>CGA construct, a control for normalizing the activity of both luciferases </p>
</div>
<br>

<p><strong>2- TAAA:</strong> This construct serves as a negative control for the
   Dual-Luciferase Assay. In this case, the STOP codon was modified by changing 
   its central nucleotide (G → A) and adding one extra nucleotide immediately after
    it, introducing a frameshift. As a result, even if the ribosome continues
     translation beyond this point, the downstream Firefly luciferase gene will 
     be out of frame and cannot be correctly translated. Therefore, no Firefly
      signal should be detected. This control ensures that any measured Firefly
       activity in experimental constructs truly results from readthrough events
        rather than from frameshifting or reinitiation.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

    luciferase expression that are independent of SECIS-mediated readthrough.  </p>
</div>
<br>

<p><strong>3- TGA postATG mutated:</strong> This construct was designed to control for ribosomal
   reinitiation. In the natural SCR-D sequence, there is an internal ATG start codon located 
   downstream of the stop codon. This ATG could allow the ribosome to detach and then 
   reinitiate translation, leading to Firefly luciferase expression that is not due to
    true readthrough. To prevent this, the internal ATG was mutated in a way that preserved
     the SCR-D RNA structure while eliminating the reinitiation site. As a result, any Firefly 
     luciferase produced from this construct must come exclusively from readthrough events.
      By comparing this construct to the normal SCR-D (TGA) construct, we can quantify and 
      subtract the contribution of reinitiation.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>C: SCR-D parts</h4>
<p><strong>1- Only pre-diapin:</strong> This construct contains only the
   Pre-diapin region of SCR-D, and it is used to test whether this isolated 
   part is capable of producing readthrough on its own. It allows us to quantify 
   the percentage contribution of Pre-diapin to readthrough, if it is indeed able to induce it.</p>

  >

</div>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>2- No hypopin:</strong> This construct contains all parts of SCR-D except 
  for the Hypopin. It is used to determine whether this region is essential for readthrough
   to occur, or if SCR-D can bypass the STOP codon without it. It allows us to quantify
    the percentage contribution of Hypopin to readthrough.</p>

<p><strong>3- Mutated Diapin:</strong> This construct is nearly identical to the normal 
  SCR-D (TGA) element, except that the nucleotide sequence of the Diapin region was altered 
  while maintaining its predicted base pairing and secondary structure. It was designed to 
  determine whether the Diapin’s specific sequence is essential for promoting readthrough, 
  or whether its structural configuration alone is sufficient for SCR-D function. 
  This distinction is particularly important for our project, as we are exploring 
  structure-dependent mechanisms to build a riboswitch.</p>

<h3>A: Controls</h3>
<p><strong>1- Activity normalization:</strong> The construct used to normalize luciferase 
  activity in the SECIS experiments was the same as the one used in SCR-D. Since both SCR-D 
  and SECIS employ the same luciferases to measure gene expression, we were able to use the 
  SCR-D luciferase normalization construct for normalization in the SECIS experiments.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>2- Negative control / Bad SECIS:</strong> 
 This construct does not contain any element that enables readthrough, 
 and is therefore used to determine the amount of Firefly luciferase produced as a
  result of spontaneous ribosomal readthrough, experimental background, reinitiation, 
  or other possible experimental artifacts. Thus, in constructs with SECIS, we can determine 
  what percentage of Firefly luciferase corresponds to this background noise and what percentage
   actually corresponds to the readthrough driven by SECIS.

<p><strong>3- SECIS control:</strong> This is the construct we used to verify that the SCR element of 
  our riboswitch, namely SECIS, functions on its own. This construct is very important because, before 
  testing our riboswitch, it allowed us to confirm that the SECIS element works and is in the proper 
  conditions to carry out readthrough.</p>

  </div>

<p><strong>4- Aptamer control:</strong> 
This construct allows us to verify the aptamer’s structural responsiveness 
to the ligand under our experimental conditions before testing it within the riboswitch context.
 In this design, the presence or absence of theophylline influences the formation of a <b>pseudoknot structure</b>
  that can induce ribosomal frameshifting. If no theophylline is present, the pseudoknot that induces
   ribosomal frameshift does not fold correctly. Conversely, when theophylline is added, the pseudoknot 
   is released, allowing the ribosome to undergo frameshift and avoid a STOP codon, placing Firefly
    luciferase in the correct ORF and resulting in its expression. This sequence and design is extracted
     from Anzalone et al., <i>Reprogramming eukaryotic translation with ligand-responsive synthetic RNAb
      switches, Nature Methods (2016)</i>. https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3807

<h3>B: Switches</h3>
The following constructs represent different designs of the SECIS-based riboswitch, 
coupled with the theophylline aptamer. In their names, the letter L stands for “Linker,” 
and the accompanying number indicates the number of nucleotides inserted between the SECIS
 element and the aptamer. The L5 construct has a slightly modified version of the SECIS sequence.
 <br> 
In the absence of theophylline, the aptamer base-pairs with part of the SECIS sequence, keeping 
the two regions bound together and preventing SECIS from folding into its <b>natural structure</b>. 
The aptamer also base-pairs with the linker when there is no theophylline. When theophylline binds to
 the aptamer, this interaction is disrupted, changing the conformation of the SECIS region and 
 therefore altering Firefly luciferase expression and acting as a riboswitch for readthrough rate.

It is important to consider that these four riboswitches were designed using our model and the TADPOLE software. These two tools operate based on structural predictions provided by RNAfold and focus specifically on the energetic requirements that allow the aptamer to fluctuate between two states: bound to theophylline or unbound. The linkers were designed based on an ON-ON switch structural prediction with RNAfold. This means that a functional (non-disrupted) SECIS element is expected in the presence of theophylline, as illustrated in the riboswitch structures.
<br>
However, RNAfold has known limitations that prevent its structural predictions from being fully accurate, and these limitations appear to affect the non-canonical interactions within the functional core of SECIS. Therefore, although the in silico prediction suggested an ON-ON switch, an OFF-ON switch may be observed experimentally.

<h3>C: Dr. Copeland’s plasmid</h3>
<p>This plasmid was used in the cell-free assays as a supplement for SECIS. The SBP2 protein is essential for SECIS to induce readthrough, so its presence is required to achieve higher readthrough efficiency.</p>
