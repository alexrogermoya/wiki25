          As synthetic biology positions itself as a field of the future, the need for new tools that allow better control of protein expression and new options for genetic engineering is clear. SKIPPIT is a platform that uses cutting edge software technology to generate brand new <span class = "italic-word">riboswitches</span> by combining functional RNA elements and conformational RNA elements. The result has been the creation of a software model capable of predicting fused structures of RNA elements and the generation of a brand new tool that allows the bypass of the stop codon during translation.

        <p class="section-text">
          Synthetic biology aims to design and reprogram biological systems to perform precise, predictable tasks. This is crucial in therapeutic contexts, where gene activity must be tightly controlled in space, time, and quantity to avoid side effects and maximise efficiency (Namy 2004; Hausser 2019).
          <br><br>
          For the past 50 years, regulation strategies have revolved around transcription factor switches (Mishler 2014), CRISPR interference (Gilbert 2013), RNA interference (Fire 1998; Jackson 2003), and chemically inducible promoters (Gossen 1992; Chen 2018). While effective, each has limitations: transcriptional control can be slow due to the extra step of mRNA production and processing, RNAi can suffer from off-target effects and limited dynamic range (Jackson2003), and inducible promoters often require bulky proteins or chemicals that are hard to deliver or interfere with cell metabolism (Chen2018).

          As synthetic biology moves into gene therapy, biomanufacturing, and other high-precision fields, demand is growing for regulation methods that are faster, work at multiple layers, and deliver cleaner, noise-resistant control. Skippit is our answer to that challenge.

        <p class="section-text">
          An alternative method to control protein expression is found in translation-level control, which provides rapid responses and direct protein regulation without altering transcription (Gebauer 2004; Swami 2010). Riboswitches—RNA sequences that change structure upon binding a select molecule—are especially attractive in this context: they are compact, programmable, and highly specific. The theophylline-binding aptamer, for example, has been extensively used to regulate downstream elements when linked to open reading frames (Werstuck 1998; Rovira 2023).

        <h2 id ="new" class = "section-subtitle">A new design space: Functional RNA Elements (FREs)</h2>
        <p class="section-text">With SKIPPIT, we are taking a leap forward in the world of translation-level control, by coupling <span class = "bold-word">aptamers</span> to what we define as <span class = "bold-word">Functional RNA Elements</span> (FREs). FREs are RNA sequences able to carry out their function purely through their own structure. These FREs are capable of folding into shapes that control ribosome behaviour [cite], alter reading frames [cite], or enable stop codon readthrough [cite]</p>
        <div class = "video"></div>
        <p class="section-text">
          FREs are the “mechanical executors” of the RNA world, as their function is mechanically constricted. Traditionally, they have been fixed by their sequence and have not been controlled dynamically.
          <br><br>
          However, <span class = "highlight-word">we are changing that with SKIPPIT</span>

        <p class="section-text">
          The Skippit switch converts a static Functional RNA Element (FRE) into a ligand-responsive device by physically coupling it to a ligand-binding aptamer, connected via a short linker designed with our software
        </p>
        <div class = "video"></div>
        <p class="section-text">
          In the unbound (OFF) configuration, intentional base-pairing between the aptamer region and the FRE disrupts the FRE's functional fold and prevents its activity. We have focused on the use of a Stop Codon Readthrough Element (SCR) as our FRE, and combined it to a theophylline aptamer to create our SKIPPIT riboswitch.

        </div>
        <p class="section-text">
          When the cognate ligand binds the aptamer, those interactions are destabilised (the aptamer adopts its ligand-bound fold), freeing the FRE to refold into its functional conformation and restoring activity (ON).

          Because standard MFE folding programs cannot fully simulate ligand binding (when using aptamers), miniRNA binding (for theoholds), and so on, we need an alternative to simulate the external signal that changes the conformation of the CRE.

        <p class="section-text">
          Alongside our technical innovation, we have a deep rooted duty to transmit the inner workings of science to the population in order to truly advance the field and further scientific progress. Without this context, unchecked claims by non-experts can come across as truth to the general populace, whilst expert fact-based statements can be perceived as deceitful. In a world with rising use of AI and fabricated “facts”, we have focused on developing an educational toolkit designed to demystify the scientific process and the people behind it, fostering critical thinking and trust in science.
          <br><br>
          Traditional education often falls short in demonstrating the scientific process and the inner workings of breakthrough technologies. To shed light on these, we have developed five adaptable, low-cost activities that present science as a collective, rigorous, creative, and ethical endeavour. Covering ethics, creativity, experimentation, technology, and communication, these activities target secondary education and early college students, and can be tailored by teachers according to their needs. Supported by collaborations with foundations, associations, and local governments, our toolkit aims to outlast iGEM and help build a scientifically literate society.
