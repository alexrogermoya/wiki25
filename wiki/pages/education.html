        <h1 class ="section-title">Education plan: the many faces of science</h1>
        <p class="section-text">When it comes to science and scientists, people usually think about their experimental work in the lab. It is known that scientists, especially biologists, use a great part of their time doing experiments. The truth is that, when it comes to real science, reality is far from the widespread idea. A good scientist isn't just an expert on his field: scientists need to be innovative, analytical, communicative, discerning and, of course, have strong experimental skills. That's why at iGEM Barcelona-UB we want to foster the idea of a <span class = "highlight-word info-word" data-target= "extra1">360º scientist</span>: a professional who (while also having deep knowledge of their own scientific speciality) is aware of the world that surrounds them: they must have a broad cultural background, awareness of current events, and their critical thinking…</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">In order to implement this idea and share it to the general public, we have created a toolkit with different activities that revolve around the many fields that make a good scientist, all of them described in this wiki. The activities are designed with classrooms in mind, and offer a wide range of variety for teachers to choose from according to their best interest. The main goal is to create a <span class = "highlight-word info-word" data-target= "extra2">free, easily accessible, informative, and educational source</span> that teachers can use to teach their students important and often-overlooked skills and knowledge. This toolkit has been designed for 16-17 year-old students in their last years of mandatory secondary education. It has also been tested and for instance taken to practice. Moreover, our vision has also been implemented outside the toolkit. We have organised some workshops and participated in major science events in Catalonia.</p>

      <section id = "toolkit">
        <h1 class="section-title">The toolkit: Reineta</h1>
        
        <h2 id="goals" class="section-subtitle">The toolkit's goals and intentions</h2>
        <p class="section-text">The toolkit's intentions are to create a free-access source that teachers can use to provide young students with tools that are not commonly learned in class but that are essential. It has been conceived as a constantly developing and expanding resource, as we have encouraged its users to provide feedback, ensuring the constant evolution of the toolkit according to the users' needs. These activities are also designed to be adaptable: the person using this source can decide which activities will be done, in what order, and in what way. In a nutshell: the toolkit's main goal is to provide an external, high quality, and well-validated activity bank to help shape the scientists of the future in an easy and accessible way.</p>
        
        <h2 id="collaborators" class="section-subtitle">Collaborators</h2>
        <p class="section-text">To make the toolkit more comprehensive and concise, we have strived to establish collaborations with entities focused in training the next generation of scientific professionals. We started by contacting <span class = "highlight-word">Fundació Catalunya la Pedrera</span>, a science foundation in Catalonia that hosts science programs for highly driven young students. We tried to establish a general collaboration, so they could help us disseminate the toolkit to many schools, increasing its visibility. The foundation supports our educational and scientific project.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">We also established collaborators for the individual activities: this way, we were provided with professional experience from specialists in the different fields, helping us increase the credibility and educational relevance of our proposal. Our first collaboration was with <span class = "highlight-word">Verifica't</span>, a Catalan fact-checking platform that verifies news, political claims, and social media content to combat misinformation. With them, we built the Communication activity, which helps students recognise fake news by teaching them to research the veracity of the information provided to them.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">We have also had contact with <span class = "highlight-word">Henderson Lab in Cambridge</span> for the experimental session, which has given us advice and feedback in the experimental and educational parts of the activity.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">The toolkit is constantly open to new collaborations. For that reason, we sent the toolkit to more than 25 foundations and research centers to be able to establish new partnerships.</p>

                  Technology has always advanced alongside science, and we must adapt to it. A modern scientist should also have basic knowledge on how to take advantage of these emerging tools: AI, bioinformatics, programming, data management.... These instruments have demonstrated remarkable and seemingly limitless potential, which highlights the importance of considering technology when addressing all the dimensions of science.

      <section id = "feedback">
        <h1 class="section-title">Feedback</h1>
        <p class="section-text">Some of the activities were tried before including them on the toolkit: those were the ethics and the art one.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">In the <span class = "bold-word">ethics trial</span>, the activity was highly successful, but we realized that students tended to hold strongly polarized opinions on the topic discussed. As our primary objective is to encourage students to explore different viewpoints and appreciate diverse perspectives, we redesigned the activity to better help them consider alternative angles.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">Regarding the <span class = "bold-word">art activity</span>, the feedback we received highlighted several points for improvement. It was suggested to improve time proportions in the explanation and the activity itself. Additionally, the activity should not be too childish, as students may lose interest; they want to feel as grownups. Also, the activity should be suitable for both students who are thriving and wish to continue with science, and those who are not looking forward to doing so. To adapt to this, the questions in the activity were redesigned to be easily answered using class concepts, but could also be extended with voluntary further curiosity. Additionally, the activity should also be more adaptable to each center's needs, which we have implemented. Another point was that students used ChatGPT, which reduced creativity in the activity; therefore, it is now mandatory to complete it by hand and imagine it themselves, with ChatGPT only allowed as an additional resource after the original drawing is made. One session was not enough, so it was suggested to divide the activity into two sections, which is how it is structured now. All of these improvements have been implemented in the final version of the toolkit.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Outside the toolkit</h1>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Festa de la ciència</h2>
        <p class="section-text">The Festa de la Ciència at the University of Barcelona (UB) is an event designed to bring science closer to society in an interactive and dynamic way. This event takes place every year in the Historic Building of the UB and includes a variety of workshops carried out by researchers from different fields, all related to UB, covering different fields such as biomedicine, biology, chemistry... This activity is divided in two days, depending of the type of public coming each one: one day dedicated to school groups, which requires prior registration, and another day open to the general public, where anyone can participate freely. The goal of this initiative is to help students and kids discover science in a more practical, engaging, and accessible format.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">Our team took part in this year's edition, introducing children to <span class = "highlight-word">transcription and translation through a bracelet-making activity</span> that served as a hands-on way for them to grasp the concepts. As a team, we were present for two days, helping to set up the stand, explaining the theoretical foundations to the children, and assisting all participants as they carried out the activity. Overall, it was an outstanding experience beyond the toolkit, which enabled us to teach all attendees about the fundamentals of synthetic biology and the key processes within the central dogma of molecular biology.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">BIYSC talks</h2>
        <p class="section-text">BIYSC stands for the <span class = "highlight-word">Barcelona International Youth Science Challenge</span>. It is an intensive, two-week residential science program held annually in Barcelona and organized by Fundació Catalunya La Pedrera. In it, students have the opportunity to conduct genuine research in groups, as well as engage in social and team-building activities.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">As some of our team members help coordinate this programme, we had the chance to present iGEM and our team's project. It was an excellent opportunity to promote iGEM, our project, and the significance of synthetic biology.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Nit de la recerca</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Nit de la Recerca is a big science festival that takes place every year across Europe on September. In Catalonia, researchers, schools, and universities team up to run workshops, experiments, and fun activities that bring science closer to everyone. It's all about making research exciting and accessible, especially for students and families. In this year's edition, our iGEM UB team has been selected to deliver a <span class = "highlight-word">virtual short talk</span> that will be spread around the territory, and to do the art workshop which is part of the toolkit.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Catalunya Summit</h2>
        <p class="section-text">The Catalunya Summit is a free event designed for young entrepreneurs and innovators aged 17 to 25. The goal of it is to inspire, empower, and connect emerging ideas in a collaborative environment. The 4th edition took place on Saturday, May 10, 2025, at the Espai Jove La Nau in Vilafranca del Penedès. Our iGEM team had the opportunity to take part in the Catalunya Summit 2025 in Vilafranca del Penedès. Having the opportunity to be surrounded by so many young entrepreneurs and innovators was both exciting and inspiring. This gave us the perfect space to share our ideas, goals and meet new contacts that were interested in our project and ideas.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Cosmoxarxa</h2>
        <p class="section-text">La CosmoXarxa is an initiative that emerged from the CosmoCaixa Explainers Community in Barcelona. Explainers are young science communicators at CosmoCaixa, typically university students or recent graduates in scientific disciplines. This community was established from a shared aspiration among former Explainers to remain connected with one another and to continue disseminating scientific knowledge beyond their tenure at the museum.</p>

                description: 'Technology has always advanced alongside science, and we must adapt to it. A modern scientist should also have basic knowledge on how to take advantage of these emerging tools: AI, bioinformatics, programming, data management.... These instruments have demonstrated remarkable and seemingly limitless potential, which highlights the importance of considering technology when addressing all the dimensions of science. For that reason, we thought it was essential to include an activity with technology as its main focus. The activities we have developed focus specially on PDB, BLAST, AlphaFold, and software tools. All of them aim to provide students with hands-on experience using these technologies, so they can understand how they are applied, what they are useful for, and the basic theoretical concepts behind each tool. As the conceptual part of this type of activity may be challenging for a 16-year-old student, they include additional explanation, contextualization, and final reflection questions to ensure a clear understanding of the activity\'s foundations.',

                description: 'One of the other disciplines we considered essential for a scientist is understanding whether weather information is reliable or not. For that reason, we considered that a communication activity would be a great idea. The main goal related to this tool was to help the students learn to distinguish fake from factual information, providing them with different strategies to assess the veracity of certain news, for example, and showing them some examples to do so. For this activity, we collaborated with Verificat, which, as mentioned, is a Catalan fact-checking platform that verifies news, political claims, and social media content to combat misinformation. One of the activities that Verificat offers consists of educational sessions about identifying fake news. Given the alignment of our goals, we developed a joint activity in which they provided us with techniques to detect false information. The sessions were designed so that students could learn these concepts in a way that is primarily applicable to science.',

How can we regulate emerging techniques when they are arising at such a swift pace? We must remain aware of the social and ethical repercussions of our research, and a competent scientist should possess the capacity to assess, reason critically, and reflect upon these dimensions. For that reason, we devised an activity that enables students to grasp the diverse perspectives within a bioethical dilemma, allowing them to comprehend and rationalize the ethical considerations underlying practical situations encountered in real life. Apart from the various institutions involved in the situation, the activity is designed to be conducted in a debate format. All the specifications are available on the toolkit webpage. Consequently, a pilot of the initial versions of this activity was implemented in a school known to one of the team members, which enabled us to apply the insights we acquired from conducting it for the first time. Owing to that experience, we have been able to refine the activity in the most effective way possible and present an improved final version of it.',

For that reason, we considered it highly important to include an activity that allowed students to feel as though they were conducting an actual experiment: handling reagents with great care, exercising caution and attentiveness, and following a protocol are some of the essential practices that can be acquired through this activity. In the activity we have designed, the objective is to extract DNA from fruit by following a detailed protocol. Furthermore, the activity concludes with a set of comprehension questions, which help students internalize the theoretical concepts related to biology. Concluding questions are incorporated into all activities in order to ensure a thorough understanding of the subject matter.',

Even when we discuss papers and articles, we are engaging with literature! For this reason, we decided that art would be an excellent field to incorporate into the toolkit. In the activity, students explore evolution, natural selection, and symbiosis by designing organisms adapted to different planets. Participants embark on a creative mission, developing life forms with specific traits and ecological relationships. The project also fosters collaboration, as schools can share their creations and explore contributions from other participants on a Galactic Map, making science both engaging and imaginative.',
