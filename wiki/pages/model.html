    Our project revolves around a <b>model</b> that captures the <b>structural behaviour of RNA</b> 
    and its role in <b>gene regulation</b>. The model describes how <b>two sequences</b> can fold into
     <b>functional structures</b>, and how these structures can be dynamically altered by <b>external
         signals</b>. By translating these <b>structural changes</b> into <b>measurable effects on

    <p class="section-text">Over 50 years ago, the discovery of three nuclear RNA polymerases in bacteriophages and bacteria allowed us to characterise and understand the intricacies of transcription.<b><sup>[1]</sup></b> Since then, synthetic biology has relied heavily on the use of transcriptional-level control to regulate gene expression and synthesise proteins in uncountable situations.</p>

    <!-- TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL COMPLEXITY -->
    <p class="section-text">Transcriptional-level control of genes is a complex system, as it relies on a large amount of circumstances: a wide variety of DNA-binding factors such as <span class="highlight-word info-word" data-target="transcription-factors">transcription factors</span> (which interact with each other and other proteins), the ability of RNA polymerases to recognise the promoter region, the RNA polymerases' own regulation strategies, the presence of nucleosomes (which inhibit initiation), presence of CpG islands in the promoter sequence, distance of the promoter to enhancer and silencer sequences, amongst others.<b><sup>[4, 10]</sup></b></p>

        <!-- FREs SECTION -->
        <h2 id="fres" class="section-subtitle">Functional RNA Elements (FREs): Molecular Switches Controlled by Shape</h2>
        
        <p class="section-text">A <span class="bold-word">Functional RNA Element (FRE)</span>—previously called Structural RNA Element (SRE)—is a segment of RNA that must fold into a very specific shape to perform its biological function.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Think of RNA as a flexible string that can fold into a precise shape, like a <span class="italic-word">key that fits a lock</span>. Its function depends entirely on maintaining this shape: if the fold is disrupted, the element stops working.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle2">Why Shape Matters</h3>
        <p class="section-text">The folded shape of a FRE is what allows it to interact with other molecules or cellular machinery in the correct way. By designing the sequence to favor the correct fold, we can control whether the element is active or inactive.</p>

        <!-- CREs SECTION -->
        <h2 id="cres" class="section-subtitle">Conformational RNA Elements (CREs): Molecular Sensors</h2>
        
        <p class="section-text">A <span class="bold-word">Conformational RNA Element (CRE)</span> is a segment of RNA that acts as a sensor. Its defining feature is that it changes shape when it detects a specific signal, such as a molecule, a temperature change, or another environmental factor. Crucially, the CRE's shape by itself does not carry out any function; it simply responds to the signal.

        <h3 class="section-subtitle2">How CREs Work</h3>
        
        <div class="card chocolate-card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Simple analogy: A CRE is like a Chunk of Chocolate

              <div class="chocolate-melted"></div>
            </div>
          </h3>
          <ul class="point-list">
            <li>At room temperature, it is <span class="bold-word">solid</span></li>
            <li>When it warms up, it <span class="bold-word">melts</span></li>
            <li>This change in state doesn't do anything by itself; the chocolate doesn't trigger any action—it simply <span class="italic-word">responds to the signal</span> (heat)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This illustrates the essence of a Conformational RNA Element (CRE): it detects a signal and changes its shape, but by itself, that change has no direct function. It is purely a sensor.</p>

    <p class="section-text">Beyond the basic thermodynamic requirements, successful RNA switch design requires careful validation of structural and functional criteria. These checks ensure that your designed switch will behave as intended in both OFF and ON states.</p>

    <h2 id="off-disruption" class="section-subtitle">OFF Disruption: Ensuring Functional Repression</h2>
    
    <p class="section-text">In the OFF state, the FRE must be prevented from performing its function. This is achieved by disrupting the specific structural features that the FRE requires to work.</p>

    <div class="recommendation-box">
        <h4>Validation Check: OFF Disruption</h4>
        <p><span class="bold-word">What to verify:</span> In the predicted OFF fold, confirm that the FRE's key functional structure is sequestered or paired with other parts of the construct.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-word">Why it matters:</span> If the FRE can still adopt its functional structure in the OFF state, your switch will leak—it will be partially active even when it should be completely repressed.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example: SECIS Element Disruption</h4>
        <p>For a SECIS element (which requires a specific hairpin structure), verify that in the OFF fold:</p>
        <ul class="point-list">
            <li>The stem region of the SECIS hairpin is disrupted by pairing with CRE or linker nucleotides<sup>[18,35]</sup></li>

    <p class="section-text">One of the most widely used tools for RNA secondary structure prediction is <span class="bold-word">RNAfold</span>, part of the ViennaRNA package. It uses a thermodynamics-based algorithm to calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) structure—the most stable conformation expected for the sequence. RNAfold outputs both the predicted structure and its associated free energy value, providing an estimate of stability<sup>[37,38]</sup>.</p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle2">Why "About Half the Binding Energy"?</h3>
    
    <p class="section-text">The inequality <span class="equation">0 < Δ < E<sub>bind</sub></span> is the correct thermodynamic requirement. Choosing Δ near E<sub>bind</sub>/2 gives a comfortable margin so:</p>
    
    <ul class="point-list">
        <li>OFF is clearly favoured in the absence of ligand (so the system is quiet / repressed), and</li>
        <li>ON becomes clearly favoured after adding the ligand (so the switch flips decisively).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="section-text">If Δ is too small (close to 0) the system will be noisy and leak (both states may be populated). If Δ is too large (approaching E<sub>bind</sub> or exceeding it) the ligand cannot flip the switch.</p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle2">Practical Numeric Guidance and Examples</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example (Theophylline-like)</h4>
        <ul class="point-list">
            <li>Literature E<sub>bind</sub> ≈ 9.5 kcal·mol⁻¹</li>
            <li>Target Δ ≈ E<sub>bind</sub>/2 ≈ 4.7 kcal·mol⁻¹</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><span class="bold-word">Suppose your predicted MFEs are:</span></p>
        <ul class="point-list">
            <li>G<sub>OFF</sub> = -44.0 kcal·mol⁻¹; G<sub>ON</sub> = -39.3 kcal·mol⁻¹</li>
            <li>Then Δ = -39.3 - (-44.0) = +4.7 kcal·mol⁻¹ → meets the target</li>
            <li>After binding: G<sub>ON,eff</sub> = G<sub>ON</sub> - E<sub>bind</sub> = -39.3 - 9.5 = -48.8, which is lower than -44.0 → ON will be favoured after ligand binding<sup>[27,28]</sup></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example (miniRNA Trigger, Small Binding)</h4>
        <p>If E<sub>bind</sub> is small (e.g., 1–2 kcal·mol⁻¹), then you need a correspondingly small Δ (≈0.5–1 kcal) — smaller margins reduce robustness and increase sensitivity to modelling error; be cautious and pair with strong structural checks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>If E<sub>bind</sub> is Unknown</h4>
        <p>Use a conservative Minimum ΔMFE between 3–5 kcal·mol⁻¹ as a first pass unless you have stronger estimates. Also perform sensitivity scans across possible E<sub>bind</sub> values and check how many candidate linkers survive.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">Experimental Validation</h1>
    <p class="section-text">We are very pleased to say that of the 4 different systems we tried in the lab,
         all of them successfully modulated the FRE element in the presence and absence of the external signal
          (ligand in our case) as an
          OFF-ON switch. Please, see the  <a class="link-text" href="https://2025.igem.wiki/barcelona-ub/model-guidance">How the Model Guided Our Progect Page</a>  
          for a description of our particular designs with the concrete elements used.
        <br>
    We have been able to convert our switches from an in silico design to reality. 
    For further details, you can check the Results or Parts page    
    <br>
    About how the results affect the model: we obtained 4 functional switches for 
    each different proposal tested in the lab. We saw how the addition of theophylline 
    provoked some changes in the system that led to a reduction in the level of readthrough.  
    <br>
    However, let’s go beyond, analysing the expectations we had on our model:
    <br>
    The systems designed with aptamers are usually built by testing hundreds or even thousands of possible sequences, until one is found that performs the expected behaviour. 
     <br>
    However, we could not afford that method so if we wanted to design some switches we needed something to narrow it down. So we built Tadpole, a tool that automatises the design of the desired switches. 
    The aim was to be able to build two structures, that had
        <ul class="point-list">
            <li>Similar energies, so none would be much more stable than the other, 
                and the switch would be possible.</li>
            <li>
                Enough complementarity (aided by the linker) in order to make the pairing 
                of the CRE to the FRE possible, so it would disrupt it. 

            </li>
        </ul>
        The software also predicts the structures, to try to have an approximation to what the final design is
         going to look like, and if it’s going to be an ON-ON or an OFF-ON. However, as was acknowledged 
         on the Core Assumptions section, RNAFold has limitations on structure prediction, so it’s not 100% 
         reliable. In fact, the structures predicted for our systems indicated an ON-ON system, but the lab 
         results demonstrate it is an OFF-ON.<br>

         With this, we can affirm that our model can be used to build RNAswitches, 
         and that we have a software tool able to automate it, with which anyone can make a <span class="highlight-word info-word" data-target="semi-rational">semi-rational design</span>, 
         so they can create a handful of sequences to test in the lab, instead of what would be the usual 
         when working with aptamers: testing hundreds and hundreds.
         <br>
         We didn’t just make our project possible with this model and our software tool.
          We created a framework that empowers other teams to design and test these systems
           more easily and efficiently.
