        <p class="section-text">Over 50 years ago, the discovery of three nuclear RNA polymerases in bacteriophages and bacteria allowed us to characterise and understand the intricacies of transcription. Since then, synthetic biology has relied heavily on the use of transcriptional-level control to regulate gene expression and synthesise proteins in uncountable situations.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Transcriptional-level control of genes is a complex system, as it relies on a large amount of circumstances: a wide variety of DNA-binding factors such as <span class="highlight-word info-word" data-target="transcription-factors">transcription factors</span> (which interact with each other and other proteins), the ability of RNA polymerases to recognise the promoter region, the RNA polymerases' own regulation strategies, the presence of nucleosomes (which inhibit initiation), presence of CpG islands in the promoter sequence, distance of the promoter to enhancer and silencer sequences, amongst others.</p>

        <p class="section-text">It is undeniable that despite its complexity and many playing factors, transcriptional-level control has evolved way beyond its original bounds and has established itself as the <span class="highlight-word">king of gene regulation</span>.

        <!-- FREs SECTION -->
        <h2 id="fres" class="section-subtitle">Functional RNA Elements (FREs): Molecular Switches Controlled by Shape</h2>
        
        <p class="section-text">A <span class="bold-word">Functional RNA Element (FRE)</span>—previously called Structural RNA Element (SRE)—is a segment of RNA that must fold into a very specific shape to perform its biological function.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Think of RNA as a flexible string that can fold into a precise shape, like a <span class="italic-word">key that fits a lock</span>. Its function depends entirely on maintaining this shape: if the fold is disrupted, the element stops working.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle2">Why Shape Matters</h3>
        <p class="section-text">The folded shape of a FRE is what allows it to interact with other molecules or cellular machinery in the correct way. By designing the sequence to favor the correct fold, we can control whether the element is active or inactive.</p>

        <!-- CREs SECTION -->
        <h2 id="cres" class="section-subtitle">Conformational RNA Elements (CREs): Molecular Sensors</h2>
        
        <p class="section-text">A <span class="bold-word">Conformational RNA Element (CRE)</span> is a segment of RNA that acts as a sensor. Its defining feature is that it changes shape when it detects a specific signal, such as a molecule, a temperature change, or another environmental factor. Crucially, the CRE's shape by itself does not carry out any function; it simply responds to the signal.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle2">How CREs Work</h3>
        
        <div class="card chocolate-card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Simple analogy: A CRE is like a Chunk of Chocolate

            <li>At room temperature, it is <span class="bold-word">solid</span></li>
            <li>When it warms up, it <span class="bold-word">melts</span></li>
            <li>This change in state doesn't do anything by itself; the chocolate doesn't trigger any action—it simply <span class="italic-word">responds to the signal</span> (heat)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This illustrates the essence of a Conformational RNA Element (CRE): it detects a signal and changes its shape, but by itself, that change has no direct function. It is purely a sensor.</p>

        <!-- COMBINING SECTION -->
        <h2 id="combining" class="section-subtitle">Combining FREs and CREs: Creating an ON/OFF Switch</h2>
        
        <p class="section-text">Individually, FREs are functional elements that only work if they maintain a precise shape, while CREs are sensors that change shape in response to a signal but have no function by themselves. When we link a CRE to an FRE, we can create a <span class="highlight-word">programmable molecular switch</span> that controls the FRE's activity.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle2">How It Works</h3>

          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="card-title">OFF State (no signal)</h3>

            <h3 class="card-title">ON State (signal present)</h3>

                  <p>Here, the CRE itself doesn't do the work; it modulates whether the FRE can fold into its functional shape, creating a signal-dependent ON/OFF switch.</p>

        <p class="section-text">By combining CREs and FREs, we gain precise, modular control over RNA-based regulation.

        <h3 id="linker" class="section-subtitle2">The Linker: The Dynamic Hinge of the RNA Switch</h3>
        
        <p class="section-text">Simply placing a Conformational RNA Element (CRE) next to a Functional RNA Element (FRE) is not enough to create a reliable ON/OFF switch. The key component that orchestrates their interaction is the <span class="bold-word">linker</span>, a short RNA segment, typically 6–10 nucleotides long, that acts as a mechanical hinge connecting the sensor (CRE) to the effector (FRE).</p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle3">Function of the Linker</h4>
        <p class="section-text">The linker is not a passive connector. Its sequence and length determine how the CRE and FRE fold and interact. A properly designed linker ensures that the system can reliably toggle between OFF and ON states.</p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle3">Design Principles</h4>
        <ul class="point-list">
            <li><span class="bold-word">Avoid excessive binding:</span> The linker should allow enough pairing to maintain the OFF state, but not so much that the switch gets "stuck" and cannot activate when the signal arrives</li>
            <li><span class="bold-word">Optimal length:</span> Too short a linker may prevent the necessary OFF-state interaction; too long can introduce unwanted folding or too much flexibility, reducing switch precision. Typically, <span class="highlight-word">6–10 nucleotides</span> work well</li>
            <li><span class="bold-word">Enable conformational change:</span> The linker must be designed so that when the CRE changes shape, the energy released is sufficient to break the OFF-state pairings, allowing the FRE to fold into its functional ON-state</li>

                    <p class="section-text">Beyond the basic thermodynamic requirements, successful RNA switch design requires careful validation of structural and functional criteria. These checks ensure that your designed switch will behave as intended in both OFF and ON states.</p>

                        <p>The theophylline aptamer chosen had to have proven functionality. In a previous work, Anzalone et al. (2016) developed ligand-responsive RNA switches capable of regulating frameshift in eukaryotic cells.</p>
                        <p>Their system is conceptually similar to the SECIS+Aptamer, as both join an RNA structural element with an aptamer to regulate gene expression. From the aptamers tested, <span class="bold-word">Theo-ON-5 was the most effective</span>, showing the largest difference in frameshift percentage between 0 mM and 30 mM theophylline.</p>
                        <p>Given the robust experimental validation and modularity of their aptamer designs, it was decided to adopt the theophylline aptamer from their study as the regulatory core of this thesis's synthetic switch.</p>

The core functional region remains conserved. Initial studies highlighted the importance of the core binding pocket. However, later findings pointed out that nearby regions (such as the so-called "entry site") are also important for ligand recognition and structural control.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">Our computational model does not reproduce RNA behavior with 100% accuracy. To make it viable and scalable for large-scale design, we have had to make key assumptions, which we detail below.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">RNA structure is a critical determinant of function, but for many RNA elements, the structure has not been experimentally resolved. In such cases, computational prediction tools provide a practical way to infer possible structures directly from the sequence.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-subtitle2">How Structural Prediction Works</h3>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">Prediction tools take as input the nucleotide sequence (e.g., <span class="code-text">AGUCGUAGUAAUUUCCGAUCG</span>) and return a proposed structure in the so-called <span class="bold-word">"dot-bracket notation"</span>:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="point-list">
                        <li><span class="code-text">.</span> indicates an unpaired nucleotide</li>
                        <li><span class="code-text">(</span> and <span class="code-text">)</span> indicate paired nucleotides</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">For example, RNAfold predicts the sequence <span class="code-text">AGUCGUAGUAAUUUCCGAUCG</span> to fold into <span class="code-text">.((((.((....)).))))...</span> This can be visualized as a two-dimensional secondary structure.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-subtitle2">RNAfold</h3>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">One of the most widely used tools for RNA secondary structure prediction is <span class="bold-word">RNAfold</span>, part of the ViennaRNA package. It uses a thermodynamics-based algorithm to calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) structure—the most stable conformation expected for the sequence. RNAfold outputs both the predicted structure and its associated free energy value, providing an estimate of stability.</p>

                        <li>OFF is clearly favoured in the absence of ligand (so the system is quiet / repressed), and</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">If Δ is too small (close to 0) the system will be noisy and leak (both states may be populated). If Δ is too large (approaching E<sub>bind</sub> or exceeding it) the ligand cannot flip the switch.</p>
