<p>
Quick explanation of the branches: 
</p>
<br>

<p>
The results obtained follow a progressive design logic, illustrated by a <strong>branching structure</strong>. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
We have been working with <strong>stop-codon readthrough elements</strong>, with the aim to create a library of different readthrough levels. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
Starting with SCR-D, we characterized a novel readthrough element in <strong>HEK293T cells</strong> to understand its parts, function, and determinants of readthrough efficiency. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
As a pivotal step, we explored and optimized a well-characterized readthrough element: a Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (<strong>SECIS</strong>). 
</p>
<br>

<p>
To go even further, we explored the possibility of creating an inducible SCR element by creating a riboswitch. Thus, we characterized a sensing element as well: a <strong>theophylline aptamer</strong>, in <strong>HEK293T cells</strong> too.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Another pivotal step was needed, and we transitioned to <strong>cell-free systems</strong>, to validate the <strong>SECIS and Aptamer Elements</strong>: our top candidates for <strong>building the riboswitch</strong>.
</p>
<br>

<p>
With the help of our <strong>Software</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> tools, we designed the <strong>riboswitch constructs</strong> fusing these two elements. And our final step was testing them in the lab.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Let’s take a look at what our results revealed!

    SCR-D is a stop codon readthrough (SCR) element that can stimulate substantial levels of translational readthrough, but its functional architecture remained uncharacterized until now. 
    To address this, we performed an evolutionary and structural analysis of the element, detailed in <span class="bold-word">Engineering</span>.

    To test these hypotheses, we designed the following constructs for comparison with the natural SCR-D element:<br>

  <li>Only PreDiapin</li>
  <li>Mutated Diapin (sequence altered but structure preserved)</li>
  <li>No Hypopin</li>
  <li>Natural SCR-D Element</li>

    Reporter constructs were built using a <span class="bold-word">Dual-Luciferase Assay</span> design, 
    with Renilla luciferase preceding the stop codon and Firefly luciferase following it. 
    Constructs were transfected into <span class="bold-word">HEK293 cells</span>, and readthrough was quantified as the Firefly/Renilla activity ratio.

  <p class="section-text">
    We can observe that the <span class="bold-word">natural SCR-D element</span> achieved almost 
    <span class="bold-word">9% readthrough in HEK cells</span>, confirming its strong influence. 
    The construct containing only PreDiapin reached around 6% readthrough, supporting our hypothesis that these few nucleotides play a major role despite their small size. 
    Similarly, the construct lacking the Hypopin produced ~5% readthrough, suggesting that this region contributes to the overall effect, despite its low sequence conservation. 
    Finally, the mutated Diapin construct, in which the sequence was altered but the structure preserved, maintained high readthrough at ~8%. 
    This indicates that the specific nucleotide sequence of the Diapin is not essential for activity; it just contributes to it.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Discussion</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    These results provide clear insights into the contributions of different SCR-D regions:<br><br>
     </p>
     <ul class="point-list">
  <li><span class="bold-word">PreDiapin drives most of the readthrough activity.</span> 
      Even in isolation, the short PreDiapin sequence stimulates ~6% readthrough, confirming its major role despite consisting of only a few nucleotides.
  </li>
  <li><span class="bold-word">The Diapin and Hypopin appear to modulate this effect together rather than independently.</span> 
      When the Diapin sequence is mutated but its structure is preserved, readthrough remains similar (~8%) to the natural sequence (~9%). 
      Compared to No Hypopin (~5%) and Only PreDiapin (~6%), this suggests the Diapin alone does not substantially enhance readthrough. 
      Instead, its function seems to depend on the presence of the Hypopin. 
      The Hypopin, although weakly conserved, may help stabilize structural interactions with the Diapin that facilitate readthrough.
  </li>
</ul>


  <p class="section-text">
    Taken together, these results indicate that <span class="bold-word">SCR-D’s high readthrough is driven mainly by PreDiapin</span>, 
    while the rest of the structure together provides a lesser contribution.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Implications</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    Although SCR-D achieves exceptionally high readthrough levels in mammalian cells (up to 9%), its activity depends mainly on a short conserved sequence (PreDiapin) rather than on the disruption of a structured element. 
    Because riboswitch design requires elements whose function depends on structure, we can conclude that targeting SCR-D for a riboswitch is not the most suitable strategy.<br><br>
    Nevertheless, our work provides the first functional dissection of SCR-D. 
    The distinct contributions of PreDiapin, Diapin, and Hypopin show that it can be modularly tuned to achieve different readthrough rates. 
    While not used as the basis for our riboswitch, <span class="bold-word">SCR-D is now a very valuable new part for iGEM</span> 
    (and the scientific community!), expanding the library of genetic tools for dual-protein expression and controlled co-expression in mammalian systems.

    The <span class="bold-word">SECIS (Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence)</span> element was chosen as a potential riboswitch platform because it is a well-characterized structural motif with strong and reproducible readthrough activity. 
    Unlike the SCR-D element, SECIS has been extensively studied and its function depends primarily on 
    <span class="highlight-word">RNA structure</span>, making it a fitting choice for structure-based regulation.
    <br><br>
    Before using SECIS in our riboswitch designs, we aimed to characterize its performance to:
    <br><br>
<ul class="point-list">
  <li>Identify the <span class="bold-word">optimal experimental conditions</span> for its use in HEK 293T cells.</li>
  <li>Confirm its suitability as a reliable riboswitch backbone.</li>
</ul>

    <br><br>
    The constructs used contained the SECIS element placed after the <span class="bold-word">Renilla</span> and <span class="bold-word">Firefly luciferase</span> genes. 
    Readthrough efficiency was measured as the ratio of Firefly to Renilla luminescence, normalized to a 
    <span class="bold-word">CGA construct</span> as a positive control which represents 100% readthrough.

    Literature reports indicate that selenium supplementation can enhance SECIS activity in mammalian cells. 
    To clarify this, we tested <span class="bold-word">SECIS activity under varying concentrations of both theophylline and selenium</span>, in three independent experimental rounds. 
    Across three rounds of experiments, we progressively refined our cell density, treatment conditions, and timing to ensure reproducibility. 
    Below is a summary of the experimental parameters:

  </div>

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    In the <span class="bold-word">first round</span>, SECIS showed strong readthrough levels of up to <span class="bold-word">9%</span> under basal conditions (0 mM theophylline) and at <span class="bold-word">0.5 mM</span> theophylline. 
    However, at <span class="bold-word">1 mM</span> and especially <span class="bold-word">5 mM</span>, readthrough decreased to below <span class="bold-word">6%</span>, likely due to 
    <span class="bold-word">theophylline-induced cytotoxicity</span> (as confirmed by our separate toxicity assay, see below). 
    These results demonstrate that the SECIS element is <span class="bold-word">functional in HEK cells</span>, achieving readthrough levels consistent with those reported in literature.

  <p class="section-text">
    In the second round, we tested the combined effects of <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> and <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span>. 
    While 1 mM theophylline slightly reduced readthrough, <span class="bold-word">selenium supplementation</span> increased it in a dose-dependent manner up to  
    <span class="bold-word">100 nM</span>, where the highest readthrough rate (<span class="bold-word">10.00%</span>) was observed. 
    Although replicability across replicates varied slightly, the overall trend was consistent: selenium enhances SECIS efficiency, while high theophylline concentrations are inhibitory.

    In the third round, we confirmed these observations under optimized conditions (higher cell density and shorter treatment time). 
    Some of these round’s results have limited replicability, but <span class="bold-word">readthrough levels</span> without selenium remain 
    <span class="bold-word">consistent</span> with previous rounds (<span class="bold-word">~8–9%</span>).

<h2 class="section-subtitle">Discussion and Implications</h2>
<p>Together, these results confirm that:</p>
<ul class="point-list">
  <li>
    The <span class="bold-word">SECIS element is functional and reliable</span> in HEK 293T cells, consistently performing 
    <span class="bold-word">8–10% readthrough</span> across different experimental conditions. These values are high compared to other eukaryotic readthrough elements reported in literature, demonstrating the robustness of SECIS as a translational regulator.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-word">Readthrough efficiency remained consistent</span> despite variations in cell number (30,000–100,000 cells/well) and timing (24–48 h incubation), which highlights the <span class="bold-word">reproducibility</span> of the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold-word">Selenium supplementation improved performance slightly</span>, suggesting a role in optimizing the SECIS conformation, but it is not essential for activity. In future experiments, we could try further optimization with higher selenium concentrations, alongside a selenium toxicity assay.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="bold-word">working range of theophylline</span> was defined as <span class="bold-word">0–1 mM</span>, ensuring minimal cytotoxicity while maintaining SECIS functionality.

    <!-- Selenium & Theophylline Effect -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">A: Effect on Normalization Control</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Both <span class="highlight-word">selenium</span> and <span class="highlight-word">theophylline</span>
         were necessary reagents for our SECIS and aptamer experiments. Since these compounds can directly affect
          cellular metabolism and translation efficiency, it was essential to evaluate how they influenced the 
          <span class="highlight-word">normalization control construct</span> used across all samples.</p>

      <p>To ensure accurate normalization, we included replicates of the control under every tested condition
         (each theophylline and selenium concentration) in all experiments. In all results, each construct was
          <span class="highlight-word">normalized only to a control exposed to the same experimental conditions</span>. 
          This approach ensured that any observed differences in luciferase activity were attributable
           to the experimental element (SECIS or aptamer) rather than to theophylline or selenium effects.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>As shown in <span class="highlight-word">Figure 11</span>, both theophylline and selenium influenced the CGA control construct, highlighting the need for condition-specific normalization.</p>

      <p>
      At <span class="highlight-word">0 nM selenium</span>
       and <span class="highlight-word">0 mM theophylline</span>, 
       the baseline Firefly/Renilla (FLuc/RLuc) ratio was around <span class="highlight-word">10–12%</span>,
        consistent across replicates. As the theophylline concentration increased, this ratio gradually decreased,
         reaching approximately <span class="highlight-word">8%</span> at 5 mM. This consistent trend confirms
          that <span class="highlight-word">theophylline slightly inhibits luciferase expression</span>, 
          likely due to general cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In contrast, <span class="highlight-word">selenium supplementation</span> affected the control 
      construct to a greater extent. The FLuc/RLuc ratio increased from about 
      <span class="highlight-word">10%</span> at 0 nM to up to <span class="highlight-word">18%</span> 
      at 100 nM selenium, although this effect depended on theophylline concentration. Specifically, 
      at 100 nM selenium, the ratio was around <span class="highlight-word">14%</span> with 0 mM 
      theophylline, and rose to ~<span class="highlight-word">18%</span> with 1 mM theophylline. 
      These fluctuations with selenium, also observed in the Sensing Element experiments, indicate 
      that <span class="highlight-word">selenium challenges consistency</span> but can also modulate
       translational efficiency in HEK cells, potentially through its known roles in protein synthesis 
       and redox balance.

      </div>
        <h4>Discussion and Implications</h4>
      <p>These results demonstrate that both theophylline and selenium alter the baseline 
        luciferase activity of the normalization control, and emphasize the importance of normalizing 
        every construct against a control treated with the same conditions. 
        
        <br>
        This is why all results
         presented in the SECIS and aptamer sections have been <span class="highlight-word">normalized 
            against controls treated with identical reagent concentrations</span>, ensuring that the 
            reported readthrough and frameshift rates reflect true biological effects rather than other 
            influences from the compounds themselves. 
        <br>
            Moving forward, this reinforces the need to always
             include <span class="highlight-word">internal controls under each tested condition</span> 
             to maintain accuracy and reproducibility in luciferase-based assays.</p>

    <!-- Theophylline Toxicity -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">B: Theophylline Toxicity Assay in HEK293T Cells</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Theophylline is known to have <span class="highlight-word">toxic effects at high concentrations</span> in mammalian cells, primarily through interference with phosphodiesterase activity and cellular metabolism. To ensure the viability of our experimental system and define safe treatment conditions, we performed a toxicity assay in HEK293T cells to establish the concentration range compatible with our constructs.</p>

      <p>Cells were seeded at different densities (30,000 and 70,000 cells/well) and treated with increasing 
        concentrations of theophylline, ranging from 0 to 40 mM. After 24 hours of treatment, cell morphology
         and viability were assessed under the microscope. After 48 hours, cells were counted using 10 μL samples
          in a Neubauer chamber after homogenization.</p>

      <p>This assay allowed us to determine both the <span class="highlight-word">cytotoxic threshold</span>
         of theophylline and the <span class="highlight-word">optimal seeding density</span> for subsequent 
         experiments.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>As shown in Figure 12, cell counts showed some variability, likely due to incomplete homogenization during sampling, but the general trend is clear</p>
      <ul class="point-list">
        <li>Up to 1 mM theophylline, cell numbers and morphology seem mainly unaffected.</li>
        <li>At 5 mM, a significant reduction in viable cells is observed, alongside visible changes in morphology.</li>
        <li>Above 5 mM, cell viability drops abruptly, confirming cytotoxic effects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings are consistent with the luciferase assay results, 
      in which constructs treated with <span class="highlight-word"> 5 mM theophylline consistently exhibited
       reduced Firefly luciferase activity <span>, suggesting cellular stress or death rather
        than a true biological response.</p>
      <div class="image-container">

      </div>
      <p>
          These results are clearly supported by microscopic observations at 24h (Figures 13 and 14).
           At <span class="highlight-word">30,000 cells seeded</span>, cells appear healthy and confluent
            at 0–1 mM theophylline, but show clear detachment and reduced density

                cells</span>, the same pattern is observed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In cultures treated with <span class="highlight-word">≥5 mM theophylline</span>,
           HEK293T cells show <span class="highlight-word">clear morphological signs of stress</span>,

            or A-shaped appearance. This is consistent with the <span class="highlight-word">abruptly

      <p>These results established a <span class="highlight-word">safe working concentration window</span>
         for theophylline in HEK293T cells: </p>
         <ul class="point-list">

                <li>5 mM and above induce clear cytotoxic effects.</li>

         </ul>
        <p>
  The chosen concentrations of <span class="highlight-word">theophylline</span> used in our experiments were based on this toxicity assay, which is why we only performed experiments using <span class="highlight-word">theophylline concentrations between 0 and 5 mM</span>.

  <h1 class="section-title">Branch 3: Validating the Sensing Element in HEK293T Cells</h1>

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Background</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    The <span class="bold-word">theophylline aptamer</span> was selected as our ligand-responsive element because of its exceptional 
    <span class="bold-word">specificity</span> for theophylline [7eng], its absence in mammalian cells [8eng], and its proven biocompatibility in HEK cells [9eng]. 
    Moreover, this aptamer has shown <span class="bold-word">cross-system functionality</span> [10,11eng] and possesses a 
    <span class="bold-word">well-characterized secondary structure</span>, making it an excellent candidate for riboswitch engineering.
    <br><br>
    Among the various versions available, we chose the <span class="bold-word">Theo-ON-5 variant</span> [13eng], as it displayed the largest ON/OFF ratio in frameshift efficiency. 
    Before incorporating it into our riboswitch, we aimed to:
  </p>

  <ul class="point-list">
    <li><span class="bold-word">Validate its responsiveness to theophylline.</span></li>
    <li>Identify the <span class="bold-word">optimal experimental conditions</span> for reliable use in HEK 293T cells.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-text">
    The aptamer construct used for this validation was adapted from Anzalone et al. (2016). 
    This design places the theophylline aptamer with a <span class="bold-word">frameshift-inducing pseudoknot</span> 
    between the Renilla and Firefly luciferase genes.
    <br><br>
    In this system, the aptamer’s folding state determines whether a ribosomal frameshift occurs:
  </p>

  <ul class="point-list">
    <li>Without theophylline, the pseudoknot structure does not fold correctly, preventing frameshifting and blocking Firefly luciferase expression.</li>
    <li>With theophylline, the aptamer binds the ligand and releases the pseudoknot, allowing ribosomal frameshifting and placing the Firefly luciferase gene in-frame, enabling its expression.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-text">
    This setup allows a direct measure of aptamer responsiveness by quantifying 
    <span class="bold-word">Firefly/Renilla luminescence</span>, normalized to the 
    <span class="bold-word">CGA control</span> (representing 100% translation readthrough).

    Because <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span> was required for this assay, and <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> had been tested in parallel for SECIS constructs, 
    we evaluated both factors together to ensure compatibility.
    <br><br>
    Four experimental rounds were carried out in HEK 293T cells, progressively refining cell density, treatment timing, and ligand concentrations, 
    following the same approach used for SECIS characterization with a further refining week, as detailed in Table 2.

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    This first round shows promising and consistent results. 
    The aptamer seems to respond to theophylline, with frameshift rates increasing from 
    <span class="bold-word">3–4%</span> at <span class="bold-word">0 mM</span> to 
    <span class="bold-word">6–8%</span> at <span class="bold-word">0.5–1 mM</span> theophylline. 
    At <span class="bold-word">5 mM</span>, readthrough drops below <span class="bold-word">5%</span>, likely due to 
    <span class="bold-word">cytotoxicity</span> (see toxicity assay in <span class="highlight-word" ><a onclick="showContent('branch2-controls')" style="text-decoration: none;">Controls</a></span> ).
    These results suggest that the aptamer is being responsive to theophylline, even though the ratio is not increasing very much.

  <p class="section-text">
    The second round introduces <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> to test its potential interference, and keeps evaluating responsiveness to 
    <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span>. In this case, the results were already expected as less reliable, and we can see they are less reproducible.
    <br><br>
    <span class="bold-word">Frameshift rates</span> appear to be between <span class="bold-word">2–4%</span>, with some outlier values (~7%) only in the presence of selenium. 
    This low replicability prevented clear conclusions, and the <span class="bold-word">addition of selenium seemed to reduce experimental consistency</span>, 
    possibly by destabilizing the construct or interacting with the translation machinery. 
    Consequently, further refinement of the experimental conditions was required, and we considered stopping the use of selenium, 
    since it was not essential for SECIS function and seemed to hinder reproducibility.

    In the third round, despite improved replicability, we observed <span class="bold-word">no clear responsiveness</span> to theophylline. 
    Frameshift rates remained stable around <span class="bold-word">3–4%</span>, regardless of ligand concentration.

    To test whether the promising results from the first round could be reproduced, we did a final round replicating the first round’s conditions (30,000 cells/well, 48 h incubation), as detailed in Table 2. 
    The results show a similar trend: <span class="bold-word">frameshift ratios slightly increase in response to theophylline again (from ~4% to ~6%), but not with sufficient difference to confirm consistent responsiveness.</span> 
    At 5 mM, the ratio decreases below 4% again due to toxicity, as we can see in Figure 9.

  <p class="section-text">
    We also confirmed that the issue lies in the sensing element rather than in theophylline itself. 
    This conclusion comes from analyzing the CGA positive control in each experimental round, which behaved consistently and as expected: higher theophylline concentrations led to a gradual decrease in overall luminescence due to cytotoxicity (see the Positive Control in Figure 10). 
    This demonstrates that <span class="bold-word">the ligand is active and functional, but that the aptamer construct does not respond as intended.</span>

    Across all experimental rounds, the theophylline aptamer construct <span class="bold-word">failed to show consistent or reproducible responsiveness</span> in HEK 293T cells. 
    Although some data hints at the expected trend, the differences are minor and not as large as those reported in literature.
    <br><br>
    Our team hypothesized that this could be due to temperature-related instability, as the aptamer was originally characterized at 30 °C. 
    Using it under HEK293T culture conditions (37 °C) might cause partial denaturation of its structure, impairing proper folding and ligand binding.
    <br><br>
    To further investigate this, we contacted Dr. Anzalone, who developed and characterized the <span class="bold-word">Theo-ON-5 aptamer</span> used in our study. 
    He confirmed that his team had observed similar inconsistencies when testing their frameshifting riboswitches in HEK293T cells. 
    He also noted that both the <span class="bold-word">temperature difference</span> and the 
    <span class="bold-word">intrinsic inefficiency of ribosomal frameshifting</span> in HEK cells likely contributed to these results.
    <br><br>
    Based on his advice, and with additional input from <span class="bold-word">Dr. Paul Copeland</span> and our team discussions, 
    we decided to test the construct in a <span class="bold-word">cell-free system (rabbit reticulocyte lysate)</span>, which operates at 30 °C: 
    a more suitable temperature for this aptamer. This platform provides tighter control of experimental conditions and has already been shown by Anzalone’s group to improve reproducibility.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, while the <span class="bold-word">theophylline aptamer</span> remains a promising and well-characterized sensing element in other systems, our results indicate that it 
    <span class="bold-word">performs inconsistently in HEK293T cells.</span> Future experiments in <span class="bold-word">cell-free systems</span> will allow us to evaluate its switching behavior more accurately and validate its use in combination with the SECIS element for riboswitch building.
