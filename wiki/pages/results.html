Quick explanation of the branches: 
</p>


<p>
The results obtained follow a progressive design logic, illustrated by a <strong>branching structure</strong>. 
</p>


<p>
We have been working with <strong>stop-codon readthrough elements</strong>, with the aim to create a library of different readthrough levels. 
</p>


<p>
Starting with SCR-D, we characterized a novel readthrough element in <strong>HEK293T cells</strong> to understand its parts, function, and determinants of readthrough efficiency. 
</p>


<p>
As a pivotal step, we explored and optimized a well-characterized readthrough element: a Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (<strong>SECIS</strong>). 
</p>


<p>
To go even further, we explored the possibility of creating an inducible SCR element by creating a riboswitch. Thus, we characterized a sensing element as well: a <strong>theophylline aptamer</strong>, in <strong>HEK293T cells</strong> too.
</p>


<p>
Another pivotal step was needed, and we transitioned to <strong>cell-free systems</strong>, to validate the <strong>SECIS and Aptamer Elements</strong>: our top candidates for <strong>building the riboswitch</strong>.
</p>


<p>
With the help of our <strong>Software</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> tools, we designed the <strong>riboswitch constructs</strong> fusing these two elements. And our final step was testing them in the lab.

  <strong>RESULTS OVERVIEW:</strong>
  <ul class="point-list">

    <li>We achieved the first experimental validation of <strong>SCR-D</strong> in <strong>HEK293T cells</strong>, 
      reaching up to <strong>9% readthrough</strong>. 
      Its modular domains (PreDiapin, Diapin, Hypopin) can be tuned to achieve different expression levels,
       making it a valuable tool for <strong>controlled dual-protein expression</strong>. However, as its activity mainly depends 
       on a short sequence immediately after the stop codon, we determined it is <strong>not a suitable element for 
       riboswitch applications</strong>, which rely on structural modulation.</li>

      <li>In HEK293T cells, <strong>SECIS DIO2</strong> consistently achieved <strong>8–10% readthrough</strong>, an exceptionally high rate
         for mammalian systems. These results validate it as a <strong>structurally driven and highly reliable 
         element</strong> for riboswitch construction. In the cell-free system, SECIS maintained functionality, 
         reaching up to <strong>14% readthrough</strong> when supplemented with 300 ng/μL SBP2, confirming its strong structural 
         integrity across experimental contexts.
</li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Theo-ON-5 aptamer</strong> is a promising and well-characterized sensing element in many systems, 
        but it does not perform consistently in HEK293T cells. It does, however, exhibit <strong>strong and 
        reproducible ligand responsiveness in the cell free system</strong>. This makes it a reliable sensing 
        component for in vitro riboswitch development and characterization.

      </li>

      <li>
        Binding <strong>SECIS DIO2</strong> with the <strong>Theo-ON-5 aptamer</strong> with computationally designed linkers using our own 
        developed tools produced <strong>ligand-responsive riboswitches</strong>. Upon theophylline binding,
         readthrough
         decreased consistently across variants, demonstrating a <strong>reproducible OFF-switch behavior</strong>. Linker 
         length modulated both baseline activity and switching amplitude, highlighting the role of RNA 
         architecture in functional tuning.

      </li>

      <li>
        Using <strong>TADPOLE</strong> and our <strong>energetic modeling pipeline</strong>, we successfully predicted a transition between 
        two different energetic states responsive to the presence of theophylline, and designed linkers that 
        enabled <strong>switching readthrough rates between structural conformations</strong>. Experimental results confirm the
         utility of our tools for designing and parametrizing riboswitches, and provide valuable feedback to 
         further refine linker optimization and RNA energetic modeling tools.

  <p class="section-text">
    SCR-D is newly identified a stop codon readthrough (SCR) element that can stimulate substantial levels of translational readthrough, but its functional architecture remained uncharacterized until now. 
    To address this, we performed an evolutionary and structural analysis of the element, detailed in <span class="bold-word">Engineering</span>.

    From this analysis, we identified three structural regions that could contribute to readthrough and potentially allow modular control over translational efficiency:

    We can observe that the <span class="bold-word">natural SCR-D element</span> achieved almost 
    <span class="bold-word">9% readthrough in HEK cells</span>, confirming its strong influence. 
    The construct containing only PreDiapin reached around 6% readthrough, supporting our hypothesis that these few nucleotides play a major role despite their small size. 
    Similarly, the construct lacking the Hypopin produced ~5% readthrough, suggesting that this region contributes to the overall effect, despite its low sequence conservation. 
    Finally, the mutated Diapin construct, in which the sequence was altered but the structure preserved, maintained high readthrough at ~8%. 
    This indicates that the specific nucleotide sequence of the Diapin is not essential for activity; it just contributes to it.

  <br>
  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Discussion</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    These results provide clear insights into the contributions of different SCR-D regions:<br><br>
     </p>
     <ul class="point-list">
  <li><span class="bold-word">PreDiapin drives most of the readthrough activity.</span> 
      Even in isolation, the short PreDiapin sequence stimulates ~6% readthrough, confirming its major role despite consisting of only a few nucleotides.
  </li>
  <li><span class="bold-word">The Diapin and Hypopin appear to modulate this effect together rather than independently.</span> 
      When the Diapin sequence is mutated but its structure is preserved, readthrough remains similar (~8%) to the natural sequence (~9%). 
      Compared to No Hypopin (~5%) and Only PreDiapin (~6%), this suggests the Diapin alone does not substantially enhance readthrough. 
      Instead, its function seems to depend on the presence of the Hypopin. 
      The Hypopin, although weakly conserved, may help stabilize structural interactions with the Diapin that facilitate readthrough.
  </li>
</ul>


  <p class="section-text">
    Taken together, these results indicate that <span class="bold-word">SCR-D’s high readthrough is driven mainly by PreDiapin</span>, 
    while the rest of the structure together provides a lesser contribution.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Implications</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    Although SCR-D achieves exceptionally high readthrough levels in mammalian cells (up to 9%), its activity depends mainly on a short conserved sequence (PreDiapin) rather than on the disruption of a structured element. 
    Because riboswitch design requires elements whose function depends on structure, we can conclude that targeting SCR-D for a riboswitch is not the most suitable strategy.<br><br>

    The <span class="bold-word">SECIS (Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence)</span> element was chosen as a potential riboswitch platform because it is a well-characterized structural motif with strong and reproducible readthrough activity.

    Literature reports indicate that selenium supplementation can enhance SECIS activity in mammalian cells. 
    To clarify this, we tested <span class="bold-word">SECIS activity under varying concentrations of both theophylline and selenium</span>, in three independent experimental rounds. 
    Across three rounds of experiments, we progressively refined our cell density, treatment conditions, and timing to ensure reproducibility. 
    Below is a summary of the experimental parameters:

  </div>

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    In the <span class="bold-word">first round</span>, SECIS showed strong readthrough levels of up to <span class="bold-word">9%</span> under basal conditions (0 mM theophylline) and at <span class="bold-word">0.5 mM</span> theophylline. 
    However, at <span class="bold-word">1 mM</span> and especially <span class="bold-word">5 mM</span>, readthrough decreased to below <span class="bold-word">6%</span>, likely due to 
    <span class="bold-word">theophylline-induced cytotoxicity</span> (as confirmed by our separate toxicity assay, see below). 
    These results demonstrate that the SECIS element is <span class="bold-word">functional in HEK cells</span>, achieving 
    readthrough levels consistent with (and mostly higher than) those reported in literature[4,6].

  <p class="section-text">
    In the second round, we tested the combined effects of <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> and <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span>. 
    While 1 mM theophylline slightly reduced readthrough, <span class="bold-word">selenium supplementation</span> increased it in a dose-dependent manner up to  
    <span class="bold-word">100 nM</span>, where the highest readthrough rate (<span class="bold-word">10.00%</span>) was observed. 
    Although replicability across replicates varied slightly, the overall trend was consistent: selenium enhances SECIS efficiency, while high theophylline concentrations are inhibitory.

    In the third round, we confirmed these observations under optimized conditions (higher cell density and shorter treatment time). 
    Some of these round’s results have limited replicability, but <span class="bold-word">readthrough levels</span> without selenium remain 
    <span class="bold-word">consistent</span> with previous rounds (<span class="bold-word">~8–9%</span>).

    As we can see, the <span class="bold-word">highest readthrough rates</span> across the three rounds are achieved with

<p>Together, these results confirm that:</p>

    The <span class="bold-word">SECIS element is functional and reliable</span> in HEK 293T cells, consistently performing

    <!-- Selenium & Theophylline Effect -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">A: Effect on Normalization Control</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Both <span class="highlight-word">selenium</span> and <span class="highlight-word">theophylline</span>
         were necessary reagents for our SECIS and aptamer experiments. Since these compounds can directly affect
          cellular metabolism and translation efficiency, it was essential to evaluate how they influenced the 
          <span class="highlight-word">normalization control construct</span> used across all samples.</p>

      <p>To ensure accurate normalization, we included replicates of the control under every tested condition
         (each theophylline and selenium concentration) in all experiments. In all results, each construct was
          <span class="highlight-word">normalized only to a control exposed to the same experimental conditions</span>. 
          This approach ensured that any observed differences in luciferase activity were attributable
           to the experimental element (SECIS or aptamer) rather than to theophylline or selenium effects.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>As shown in <span class="highlight-word"><span class="bold-word">Figure 11</span></span>, both theophylline and selenium influenced the CGA control construct, highlighting the need for condition-specific normalization.</p>

      <p>
      At <span class="highlight-word">0 nM selenium</span>
       and <span class="highlight-word">0 mM theophylline</span>, 
       the baseline Firefly/Renilla (FLuc/RLuc) ratio was around <span class="highlight-word">10–12%</span>,
        consistent across replicates. As the theophylline concentration increased, this ratio gradually decreased,
         reaching approximately <span class="highlight-word">8%</span> at 5 mM. This consistent trend confirms
          that <span class="highlight-word">theophylline slightly inhibits luciferase expression</span>, 
          likely due to general cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In contrast, <span class="highlight-word">selenium supplementation</span> affected the control 
      construct to a greater extent. The FLuc/RLuc ratio increased from about 
      <span class="highlight-word">10%</span> at 0 nM to up to <span class="highlight-word">18%</span> 
      at 100 nM selenium, although this effect depended on theophylline concentration. Specifically, 
      at 100 nM selenium, the ratio was around <span class="highlight-word">14%</span> with 0 mM 
      theophylline, and rose to ~<span class="highlight-word">18%</span> with 1 mM theophylline. 
      These fluctuations with selenium, also observed in the Sensing Element experiments, indicate 
      that <span class="highlight-word">selenium challenges consistency</span> but can also modulate
       translational efficiency in HEK cells.
    </p>

      </div>
        <h4>Discussion and Implications</h4>
      <p>These results demonstrate that both theophylline and selenium alter the baseline 
        luciferase activity of the normalization control, and emphasize the importance of normalizing 
        every construct against a control treated with the same conditions. 
        
        <br>
        This is why all results
         presented in the SECIS and aptamer sections have been <span class="highlight-word">normalized 
            against controls treated with identical reagent concentrations</span>, ensuring that the 
            reported readthrough and frameshift rates reflect true biological effects rather than other 
            influences from the compounds themselves. 
        <br>
            Moving forward, this reinforces the need to always
             include <span class="highlight-word">internal controls under each tested condition</span> 
             to maintain accuracy and reproducibility in luciferase-based assays.</p>

    <!-- Theophylline Toxicity -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">B: Theophylline Toxicity Assay in HEK293T Cells</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Theophylline is known to have <span class="highlight-word">toxic effects at high concentrations</span> in mammalian cells, primarily through interference with phosphodiesterase activity and cellular metabolism. To ensure the viability of our experimental system and define safe treatment conditions, we performed a toxicity assay in HEK293T cells to establish the concentration range compatible with our constructs.</p>

      <p>Cells were seeded at different densities (30,000 and 70,000 cells/well) and treated with increasing 
        concentrations of theophylline, ranging from 0 to 40 mM. After 24 hours of treatment, cell morphology
         and viability were assessed under the microscope. After 48 hours, cells were counted using 10 μL samples
          in a Neubauer chamber after homogenization.</p>

      <p>This assay allowed us to determine both the <span class="highlight-word">cytotoxic threshold</span>
         of theophylline and the <span class="highlight-word">optimal seeding density</span> for subsequent 
         experiments.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>As shown in <span class="bold-word">Figure 11</span>, cell counts showed some variability, likely due to incomplete homogenization during sampling, but the general trend is clear</p>
      <ul class="point-list">
        <li>Up to 1 mM theophylline, cell numbers and morphology seem mainly unaffected.</li>
        <li>At 5 mM, a significant reduction in viable cells is observed, alongside visible changes in morphology.</li>
        <li>Above 5 mM, cell viability drops abruptly, confirming cytotoxic effects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings are consistent with the luciferase assay results, 
      in which constructs treated with <span class="highlight-word"> 5 mM theophylline consistently exhibited
       reduced Firefly luciferase activity <span>, suggesting cellular stress or death rather
        than a true biological response.</p>

      <p>
          These results are clearly supported by microscopic observations at 24h (Figures 13 and 14).
           At <span class="highlight-word">30,000 cells seeded</span>, cells appear healthy and confluent
            at 0–1 mM theophylline, but show clear detachment and reduced density

    Because <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span> was required for this assay, and <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> had been tested in parallel for SECIS constructs, 
    we evaluated both factors together to ensure compatibility.
    <br><br>
    Four experimental rounds were carried out in HEK 293T cells, progressively refining cell density, treatment timing, and ligand concentrations, 
    following the same approach used for SECIS characterization with a further refining week, as detailed in Table 2.

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    This first round shows promising and consistent results. 
    The aptamer seems to respond to theophylline, with frameshift rates increasing from 
    <span class="bold-word">3–4%</span> at <span class="bold-word">0 mM</span> to 
    <span class="bold-word">6–8%</span> at <span class="bold-word">0.5–1 mM</span> theophylline. 
    At <span class="bold-word">5 mM</span>, readthrough drops below <span class="bold-word">5%</span>, likely due to 
    <span class="bold-word">cytotoxicity</span> (see toxicity assay in <span class="highlight-word" ><a onclick="showContent('branch2-controls')" style="text-decoration: none;">Controls</a></span> ).
    These results suggest that the aptamer is being responsive to theophylline, even though the ratio is not increasing very much.

  <p class="section-text">
    The second round introduces <span class="bold-word">selenium</span> to test its potential interference, and keeps evaluating responsiveness to 
    <span class="bold-word">theophylline</span>. In this case, the results were already expected as less reliable, and we can see they are less reproducible.
    <br><br>
    <span class="bold-word">Frameshift rates</span> appear to be between <span class="bold-word">2–4%</span>, with some outlier values (~7%) only in the presence of selenium. 
    This low replicability prevented clear conclusions, and the <span class="bold-word">addition of selenium seemed to reduce experimental consistency</span>, 
    possibly by destabilizing the construct or interacting with the translation machinery. 
    Consequently, further refinement of the experimental conditions was required, and we considered stopping the use of selenium, 
    since it was not essential for SECIS function and seemed to hinder reproducibility.

    Frameshift rates remained stable around <span class="bold-word">3–4%</span>, regardless of ligand concentration.

    To test whether the promising results from the first round could be reproduced, we did a final round replicating the first round’s conditions (30,000 cells/well, 48 h incubation), as detailed in Table 2. 
    The results show a similar trend: <span class="bold-word">frameshift ratios slightly increase in response to theophylline again (from ~4% to ~6%), but not with sufficient difference to confirm consistent responsiveness.</span> 
    At 5 mM, the ratio decreases below 4% again due to toxicity, as we can see in Figure 9.

  <p class="section-text">
    We also confirmed that the issue lies in the sensing element rather than in theophylline itself. 
    This conclusion comes from analyzing the CGA positive control in each experimental round, which behaved consistently and as expected: higher theophylline concentrations led to a gradual decrease in overall luminescence due to cytotoxicity (see the Positive Control in Figure 10). 
    This demonstrates that <span class="bold-word">the ligand is active and functional, but that the aptamer construct does not respond as intended.</span>

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Discussion and Implications</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    Across all experimental rounds, the theophylline aptamer construct 
    <span class="bold-word">failed to show consistent or reproducible responsiveness</span> in HEK 293T cells. 
    Although some data hints at the expected trend, the differences are minor and not as large as those 
    reported in literature (even though they are tested in other systems).[11, 12, 13].
    <br><br>
    Our team hypothesized that this could be due to temperature-related instability, as the aptamer was originally characterized at 30 °C. 
    Using it under HEK293T culture conditions (37 °C) might cause partial denaturation of its structure, impairing proper folding and ligand binding.

    <p>
      Anzalone, who developed and characterized the Theo-ON-5 aptamer we have used, confirmed that he had observed 
      the same inconsistent results that we did in HEK293T, which is why he never published them. 
      He recommended that we tried it in a cell-free system.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

    To further investigate this, we contacted Dr. Anzalone<span class="highlight-word info-word" data-target="hp-card1">&#128161;</span>,
     who developed and characterized the <span class="bold-word">Theo-ON-5 aptamer</span> used in our study. 
    He confirmed that his team had observed similar inconsistencies when testing their frameshifting riboswitches in HEK293T cells, which is why there were no papers published on the aptamer in this system.
    He also noted that both the <span class="bold-word">temperature difference</span> and the 
    <span class="bold-word">intrinsic inefficiency of ribosomal frameshifting</span> he had observed in HEK cells [14] likely contributed to these results.
    <br><br>
    Based on his advice, and with additional input from <span class="bold-word">Dr. Paul Copeland</span> and our team discussions, 
    we decided to test the construct in a <span class="bold-word">cell-free system (rabbit reticulocyte lysate)</span>, which operates at 30 °C: 
    a more suitable temperature for this aptamer. This platform provides tighter control of experimental conditions and has already been shown by Anzalone’s group to improve reproducibility[6, 17, 18]. 
    We already had it in mind as our second option, so it was time to use it.

    <h3 class="card-title">Final Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In conclusion, while the <strong>theophylline aptamer</strong> remains a promising and well-characterized sensing element 
      in many systems, our results indicate that it <strong>performs inconsistently in HEK293T cells</strong>. 
      Future experiments in <strong>cell-free systems</strong> will allow us to evaluate its switching behavior more accurately 
      and validate its use in combination with the SECIS element for riboswitch building.

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Background</h2>
  <p class="section-text">
    After observing inconsistent responsiveness of the theophylline aptamer in HEK293T cells, we transitioned to a <strong>cell-free expression system</strong> to test its functionality under more controlled conditions (TnT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems from Promega®). Literature reports have shown that the used theophylline aptamer performs reliably in this system, where RNA folding is less affected by cellular complexity.[11, 12]<br><br>
    In this setup, we could test the aptamer’s responsiveness directly, without cellular variability. Due to solubility limitations of <strong>theophylline</strong> in the cell-free mixture, the <strong>maximum concentration</strong> we could reach was <strong>2.4 mM</strong>, added in small volumes before the incubation step.

    In this system, <strong>selenium supplementation is not required</strong>, as the commercial lysate already contains the necessary cofactors.

      Paul Copeland has been a leading contributor in uncovering the mechanisms of <strong>selenocysteine incorporation</strong> at UGA stop codons.

  <p class="section-text">
    As shown in <strong>Figure 15</strong>, the <strong>negative control</strong> exhibits a small but consistent increase in Firefly luminescence with higher SBP2 concentrations: from <strong>~5% at 0 ng/μL</strong> to <strong>~12% at 300 ng/μL</strong>. This effect was unexpected, but it shows that SBP2 slightly influences general translation efficiency, reinforcing the importance of including controls for each condition in experiments.

  <p class="section-text">
    In contrast, the <strong>SECIS construct</strong> showed a much stronger and linear increase in readthrough efficiency. When normalized against both the CGA control and the negative control (<strong>Figure 16</strong>), readthrough rose from nearly <strong>0% at 0 ng/μL SBP2</strong> (as expected, since SBP2 is required for function) up to <strong>~12–14% at 300 ng/μL SBP2</strong>.

We also tried further controls with <strong> SBP2 concentrations up to 500 ng/uL </strong>, just to explore further potential optimization.
  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
<p class="section-text">
  In <strong>Figure 17</strong>, normalized to all controls, the <strong>SECIS-only construct</strong> displayed consistent readthrough around <strong>6%</strong>, below previous results (~12–14%). This variation may reflect batch-to-batch differences in lysate activity or fluctuations in reaction efficiency that should be further explored.
</p>

<p class="section-text">
  When the <strong>aptamer and linker</strong> are added, a clear switching behavior is observed. Even without theophylline, the addition of the linker and aptamer <strong>partially disrupts SECIS function</strong>, reducing readthrough from 6% to below 4% for L5, 3% for L7 and L8, and 2% for L9. When theophylline is added, the SECIS element is further disrupted, with its readthrough decreasing to <strong>~1% across all variants</strong>, demonstrating a <strong>consistent OFF-switch effect</strong>. 
</p>

<p class="section-text">
  Interestingly, the magnitude of switching depends on linker length: <strong>shorter linkers (L5)</strong> initially preserve SECIS structure better, resulting in smaller absolute decreases but proportionally stronger relative switching. This pattern highlights how <strong>linker architecture directly influences functional coupling</strong> between the aptamer and readthrough domains, and is an interesting aspect to note for future discussion on improving linker prediction in our software and model tools.

All conditions are tested at 300 ng/uL SBP2 and in the absence (0 mM) and presence (2.4 mM) of theophylline, which corresponds to the off and on-state of the aptamer, respectively.</p>
</div>

<p class="section-text">
  In <strong>Figure 18</strong>, we further examined control interactions. Increasing SBP2 concentration up to <strong>300 ng/μL</strong> enhanced SECIS readthrough, but <strong>500 ng/μL decreased it</strong>, likely due to competition of SBP2 with the translation machinery. Interestingly, the negative control shows even higher ratios with 500 ng/μL, emphasizing once more the importance of condition-matched normalization, but raising concerns on how to normalize samples to controls affected differently by the same reagent.

<h2 class="section-subtitle">Discussion and Implications</h2>
<p class="section-text">
  These experiments mark the successful construction and testing of our <strong>first functional riboswitch prototypes</strong>. All four designs, differing only in linker length, exhibited a <strong>consistent ligand-dependent switching effect</strong>, confirming that coupling an aptamer to a readthrough element can dynamically modulate translation.
</p>

<p class="section-text">
  As these riboswitches were designed and predicted using our <strong>model and TADPOLE software</strong>, these results give us important conclusions to evaluate them as well. These tools operate based on structural predictions provided by RNAfold and focus on the energetic requirements that allow the aptamer to fluctuate between two states: bound to theophylline or unbound. The linkers were designed based on an ON-ON switch structural prediction with RNAfold. This means that a functional (non-disrupted) SECIS element is expected in the presence of theophylline, as illustrated in the riboswitch structures.
</p>

<p class="section-text">
  However, RNAfold has known limitations that prevent its structural predictions from being fully accurate, and these limitations appear to affect the non-canonical interactions within the functional core of SECIS. Therefore, although the in silico prediction suggested an ON-ON switch, <strong>an OFF-ON switch has been observed experimentally</strong>. The activation of the aptamer has resulted in further disruption of the SECIS element, consistent across all linkers.
</p>

<p class="section-text">
  Hence, the model-guided approach <strong>successfully generated constructs that switch between two structural and functional states</strong>, validating the design pipeline. The data also provide valuable feedback for <strong>refining linker prediction algorithms</strong> and improving energetic modeling of complex RNA architectures.

  <ul class="point-list">
    <li>While our results demonstrate robust qualitative trends, <strong>further replicates and quantitative statistical analyses</strong> will strengthen and validate our conclusions.</li>
    <li>Future work will also address <strong>computational limitations</strong> identified during the project by integrating experimental feedback into prediction algorithms. For example, since non-canonical base pairs are not well captured by RNAfold, exploring tools such as <strong>RNAstructure</strong>, <strong>Rosetta FARFAR2</strong>, or <strong>deep learning–based RNA folding models</strong> can refine energetic predictions.</li>
    <li>Initiate <strong>testing of the riboswitch constructs</strong> across different cell lines and complementary in vitro systems to evaluate transferability and dynamic range.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-subtitle">Looking Towards the Future</h2>

    <li><strong>Ligand-inducible regulation</strong>: enabling circuits that respond dynamically to specific metabolites or environmental signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Compact vector design</strong>: minimizing genetic footprint while maintaining high control over expression.</li>
