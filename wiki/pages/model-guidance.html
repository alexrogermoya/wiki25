                    <p class="section-text">
                    Our project revolves around a <b>model</b> that captures the <b>structural behaviour of RNA</b> and its role in <b>gene regulation</b>. The model describes how <b>two sequences</b> can fold into <b>functional structures</b>, and how these structures can be dynamically altered by <b>external signals</b>. By translating these <b>structural changes</b> into <b>measurable effects on gene expression</b>, the model provided us with a framework to design <b>regulatory RNA switches</b>, which we were able to build and test successfully in the <b>lab</b>.<br><br>

                    This <b>framework</b> was not an add-on but <b>central</b> to our entire <b>design–build–test–learn cycle</b>. It allowed us to build a <b>software</b> following the model guidelines, with which we propose <b>switchable RNA parts</b>, predict their behaviour, and then guide the <b>construction of new parts</b> that we later successfully tested in the lab.<br><br>
                                        
                    The <b>experimental results</b> obtained from testing the <b>individual elements (SECIS and Aptamer)</b> that made up our final switch design were fed back into the <b>modelling</b> of our <b>SKIPPIT switch</b>. This helped us refine both our understanding of <b>RNA folding dynamics</b> and the specific parameters of the system we were building. In this way, the model directly connected <b>abstract structural predictions</b> with <b>concrete laboratory outcomes</b>.<br><br>
                                        
                    The <b>approach</b> is intentionally <b>general</b>: while we focused on one system for our <b>proof of concept</b>, the same <b>modelling principles</b> could inspire future iGEM teams to design other <b>RNA-based regulatory elements</b>. To make the model <b>scalable</b> for real design, we were transparent about <b>key assumptions</b>. <b>Structural predictions</b> were generated using <b>RNAfold</b>, which estimates the <b>most stable folding pattern</b> and its <b>free energy</b>. We assumed that these predicted <b>minimum free energy (MFE) structures</b> represent useful approximations of real conformations, even though <b>RNA molecules</b> in cells can occupy ensembles and are influenced by <b>proteins</b> and <b>co-transcriptional folding</b>. This simplification let us move quickly from <b>sequence</b> to <b>predicted function</b>, while keeping in mind that predictions would need <b>experimental confirmation</b>.<br><br>
                                        
                    By grounding our <b>software tool</b> and <b>lab work</b> in this model, we ensured that <b>modelling</b> was not just theoretical but an <b>active design driver</b>. The <b>insights</b> shaped our <b>constructs</b>, explained <b>unexpected results</b>, and ultimately demonstrated that <b>RNA switches</b> can be engineered as <b>modular, tunable elements</b> for <b>synthetic biology</b>.

                    <p class="section-text">The fact that RNAfold does not predict these pairings raises some concerns.

                    <p class="section-text">Riboswitches are systems in which a structured RNA sequence, called an aptamer, changes conformation when it binds to specific small molecules. This change in conformation can shift how a gene is expressed by affecting transcription, translation initiation, or RNA stability.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">In a functional, designed aptamer–RNA construct, the sequence, including the aptamer and other structural RNA elements, folds in the absence of the ligand in a specific way. When the ligand is present and binds to the aptamer, this structure is disrupted, resulting in a new conformation.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>Riboswitch Mechanism</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold-word">Unbound state:</span> Aptamer (red) and functional RNA elements (other colors) adopt one conformation</p>
                        <p><span class="bold-word">Bound state:</span> Ligand (small brown molecule) binding changes the configuration, disrupting the original structure</p>
                        <p><span class="bold-word">Functional outcome:</span> Conformational change affects gene expression through various mechanisms</p>

                    <p class="section-text">After reviewing extensive literature on aptamers, we found some key factors that can improve the likelihood of ligand binding to the aptamer:</p>

                            <p>The energy difference between the ligand-bound and unbound conformations must be relatively small. This allows the system to change between conformations without a high energetic barrier.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Interaction Optimization</h3>
                            <p>The formation of multiple strong interactions, especially ones that the ligand would need to disrupt in order to bind to the aptamer, should be avoided.</p>

                        <h4>Selected Aptamer: Theo-ON-5 from Anzalone et al. (2016)</h4>
                        <p>The theophylline aptamer chosen had to have proven functionality. In a previous work, Anzalone et al. (2016) developed ligand-responsive RNA switches capable of regulating frameshift in eukaryotic cells.</p>
                        <p>Their system is conceptually similar to the SECIS+Aptamer, as both join an RNA structural element with an aptamer to regulate gene expression. From the aptamers tested, <span class="bold-word">Theo-ON-5 was the most effective</span>, showing the largest difference in frameshift percentage between 0 mM and 30 mM theophylline.</p>
                        <p>Given the robust experimental validation and modularity of their aptamer designs, it was decided to adopt the theophylline aptamer from their study as the regulatory core of this thesis's synthetic switch.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">The tested sequences differ from each other in the number of nucleotides at the bottom part of the sequence, but they conserve the core functional part responsible for the binding of the ligand. The core functional region remains conserved. Initial studies highlighted the importance of the core binding pocket. However, later findings pointed out that nearby regions (such as the so-called "entry site") are also important for ligand recognition and structural control.</p>
