<p class = "section-text">When we first outlined our idea of creating an RNA-based tool for modulable translation, we knew that the <span class="bold-word">project’s success would depend on more than just technical design</span>. To strengthen it, we reached out to stakeholders from very different backgrounds, <span class="bold-word">opening a continuous dialogue</span> that shaped the project at every stage.

<p class = "section-text">To reflect that, across the wiki you can find <span class="highlight-word">HP cards</span> <span class = "info-word hp-icon" data-target= "hp-card">&#128161;</span> (click on the lightbulb) that connect the specific concept with the stakeholder who influenced it. The cards serve as both a map of our interactions and a record of how <span class="bold-word">external perspectives were continuously translated into tangible aspects of our project</span>, ensuring that it remains transparent, traceable and grounded in real-world dialogue. Our final goal was to make our HP work visible, so we came up with this new and creative way to achieve just that.
<br><br>
To ensure a robust experimental design, we contacted researchers and engineers to redefine wet lab design, select adequate assays, and understand the practical limits of riboswitches. Professors and experts from all over shared their advice to ground our project in <span class="bold-word">feasible experimental strategies</span> and guided us towards improvements in our <a class="link-text" href="Link-overview-2">software toolkit</a>.
<br><br>
Beyond the lab, we tested our <a class="link-text" href="Link-overview-3">education toolkit</a> with teachers and schools directly with students, offering <span class="bold-word">practical feedback</span> on clarity, engagement and proper time management. Their insights helped us define a <span class="bold-word">modular and accessible resource</span> that not just introduces the general public to the emerging ambit of synthetic biology, but also <span class="bold-word">encourages debate</span> about the ethical questions it raises.
<br><br>
In order to guarantee compliance to <span class="bold-word">biosafety standards</span>, institutions specializing in biosafety and regulation <span class="bold-word">reviewed our open-source plans</span>, validating that our tool posed low-dual use risks. In this sense, we committed to an exhaustive research of what-if scenarios that are compiled in our very own <span class="bold-word">Dual-Use Assessment</span>.
<br><br>
Through these conversations, our project evolved <span class="bold-word">from a technical proof-of-concept to a well-rounded platform</span>. As our project progressed, so did we: what began as a purely scientific challenge gradually revealed itself as a multidisciplinary effort that demanded responsibility beyond the lab. By engaging openly with stakeholders, we created a tool that not only advances synthetic biology but also embodies the principles of <span class="bold-word">responsibility, accessibility and collaboration</span> that modern science requires.

<h1 class = "section-title">Reviewing iGEM’s Maturity Models</h1>
<p class = "section-text">In 2025, the iGEM Foundation and the Responsibility Committee introduced a new framework for Human Practices evaluation: the Maturity Models. These models aim to guide teams and judges in understanding the evolution of HP work and how it can be integrated into project design.
<br><br>
The models are based on three core concepts:
</p>

<ul class = "point-list">
<li><span class="highlight-word">Reflection:</span> teams should demonstrate how project and <span class="highlight-word">design decisions have been influenced by their rationale and HP work (MM1)</span>. Additionally, work should extend beyond the laboratory –beyond the [technical] finish line– and take into account how the <span class="highlight-word">context (MM2)</span> –regulations, extant policy, and market capabilities– can influence the project.
</li>
<li><span class="highlight-word">Responsibility:</span> projects should identify, map and engage a diverse spectrum of stakeholders –industry, communities and individuals– to both incorporate <span class="highlight-word">varied perspectives (MM3)</span> into design decisions and to <span class="highlight-word">proactively anticipate (MM4)</span> positive and negative impacts, documenting the rationale behind every choice and mitigation strategy.
</li>
<li><span class="highlight-word">Responsiveness:</span>teams must <span class="highlight-word">integrate Human Practices work continuously (MM5)</span> from project inception through execution, using stakeholder feedback and contextual insights to iteratively adapt and improve their design, while <span class="highlight-word">transparently assessing limitations (MM6)</span> and charting a documented roadmap for addressing risks and seizing new opportunities.
</li>
</ul>

<p class = "section-text">We strategically aligned our HP work with the Maturity Models to ensure a <span class="bold-word">comprehensive, reflective, and responsible approach</span>. Our goal was to design a strategy that would:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Cover all dimensions of the Maturity Models,
</li>
<li>Address the specific challenges of a project with limited direct societal impact like ours,
</li>
<li>Ensure a stringent and coherent HP narrative across the wiki.
</li>
</ol>

<p class = "section-text">To achieve this, our HP work was structured into <span class="bold-word">two main categories</span>:
</p>

<div class = "accordion">
<div class = "accordion-header">
<div class = "accordion-title">Active Work</div>
<div class = "accordion-icon"></div>
</div>
<div class = "accordion-content">
<div class = "accordion-content-inner">
<p>This section encompasses activities that directly investigate and act upon the ethical, societal, and regulatory implications of our project.
<br><br>
<span class="bold-word">Dual-use Concerns</span>
<br><br>
Given the potential dual-use implications of genetic tools, this was a central part of our HP work (<span class="highlight-word">MM4</span>). We conducted an exhaustive analysis of the possible beneficial and harmful applications of our system, building upon preliminary work developed in a university bioethics course. This reflection helped shape design decisions to ensure biosecurity and ethical robustness.
<br><br><br>
<span class="bold-word">Regulatory Research</span>
<br><br>
Because our project involves the development of a new tool, we researched how similar technologies are currently regulated. Our objective was to explore how our system could fit into existing European frameworks and consider international approaches (e.g., US, Japan, UK). The findings will inform potential <span class="bold-word">guidelines for safe and responsible use</span> in research, industry, and educational contexts (<span class="highlight-word">MM2</span>).
<br><br>
<span class="bold-word">Feedback Loops and Stakeholder Engagement</span>
<br><br>
In alignment with <span class="highlight-word">MM3</span>, we established targeted stakeholder dialogues in three domains:
</p>
<ul class = "point-list">
<li><span class="bold-word">Engineering:</span> receiving technical feedback to refine our design;
</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Education:</span> engaging educators and experts to enhance outreach components;
</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Biosecurity Compliance:</span> discussing legal and ethical frameworks.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each conversation contributed concrete insights that were integrated into project decisions.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "accordion">
<div class = "accordion-header">
<div class = "accordion-title">Integrated Work</div>
<div class = "accordion-icon"></div>
</div>
<div class = "accordion-content">
<div class = "accordion-content-inner">
<p>To ensure that Human Practices were present at every stage of the project, we implemented <span class="bold-word">HP Cards</span> across the wiki. These cards accompany different sections (e.g., Engineering, Software, Education) and briefly describe how HP considerations informed specific decisions (<span class="highlight-word">MM1, MM5</span>).
<br><br>
By clicking on each card, readers can access the full explanation on the HP page. For example:
</p>
<ul class = "point-list">
<li><span class="bold-word">Theophylline Aptamer:</span> chosen for its biosafety properties, as it is a synthetic molecule not found in nature.
</li>
<li><span class="bold-word">Software Interface:</span> improved through stakeholder feedback from students and faculty.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, several HP cards explicitly acknowledge project limitations, and explain how we addressed them (<span class="highlight-word">MM6</span>). These demonstrate our commitment to integrity and transparency, especially in communicating complex technical or ethical information.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class = "section-text">Overall, our experience with the Maturity Models has been very positive. We found that they successfully encompass most, if not all, of the key aspects of Human Practices –from reflective decision-making to responsible stakeholder engagement and transparent communication. As this marks the fourth time iGEM UB has participated in the competition, our team is familiar with HP work, and we genuinely found the Maturity Models to be a useful and thoughtful framework that helped us structure and assess our progress.
<br><br>
We believe this tool will be especially valuable for new teams and future iGEM generations, offering a clear pathway for developing meaningful HP practices. At the same time, we recognize that Human Practices can be approached in many creative ways, and that overly prescriptive guidelines might risk constraining the diversity and innovation that have traditionally characterized iGEM HP work.
<br><br>
Overall, we consider the Maturity Models an excellent and insightful addition to the iGEM competition. It helped us reflect on our work in a more structured way, though we still had space for creativity and team identity.
